Allows communication between the basket and specific algorithms. Intended to
hold any kind of portfolio joint loss, latent models, top-down,....

An inconvenience of this design as opposed to the full arguments/results
is that when pricing several derivatives instruments on the same basket
not all the pricing engines would point to the same loss model; thus when
pricing a set of such instruments there might be some switching on the
basket loss models, which might require recalculations (of the basket) or
not depending on the pricing order.
