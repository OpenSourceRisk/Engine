// Boost Version
// Boost 1.63 has been tested on Linux
// Any boost version above 1.46 might work (we use boost filesystem 3 which is the default
// from 1.46 - so some modification will be needed for pre 1.46).
// The unit tests require 1.61 or higher
//
// Note that for MSVC 2013 the boost config file needs 1.57 (but this can be modified).
// Note that for MSVC 2015 the boost config file needs 1.58 (but this can be modified).
