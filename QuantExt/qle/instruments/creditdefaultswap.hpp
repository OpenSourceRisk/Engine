        instrument characteristics, it is the running only quoted
        spread that will make a CDS contract have an NPV of 0 when
        quoted for that running only spread.  Refer to: "ISDA
        Standard CDS converter specification." May 2009.

        The conventional recovery rate to apply in the calculation
        is as specified by ISDA, not necessarily equal to the
        market-quoted one.  It is typically 0.4 for SeniorSec and
        0.2 for subordinate.

        \note The conversion employs a flat hazard rate. As a result,
              you will not recover the market quotes.
