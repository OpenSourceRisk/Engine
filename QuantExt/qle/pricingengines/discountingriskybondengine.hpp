//! Discounting Risky Bond Engine
/*! WARNING: Only covers Vanilla coupon bonds (floating and fixed rate), and
    Zero Bonds (one cashflow, a redemption at maturity).

    This class implements pricing of Risky Bonds by discounting the future
    nominal cash flows using the respective yield curves, and probability of
    survival.
    The nominal recovered in case of default is calculated as recovery rate times
    the integral of probability of default until maturity date. For coupon bonds
    the coupon periods are taken as the time step for integration, for a zero
    bond the time step period provided is used.
