    \warning Cash settled swaptions are not supported

    The basis between the given discounting curve (or - if not given - the
    model curve) and the forwarding curve attached to the underlying swap's
    ibor index is taken into account by a static correction spread for
    the underlying's fixed leg. Likewise a spread on the floating leg is
    taken into account.

    Note that we assume H' does not change its sign, but this is a general
    requirement of the LGM parametrization anyway (see the base parametrization
    class).
