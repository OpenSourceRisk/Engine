/*! Interface, salvage(m) should return (p,s) with
    p = the salvaged (i.e. positive semidefinite) version of m
    s = a square root of p, if provided, otherwise an empty Matrix

    An implementation of this class represents a method to make a given covariance matrix m positive
    semidefinite. This includes an implementation  that just returns the input matrix unchanged, e.g. for
    cases where it is known in advance / for theoretical reasons that the matrix m is positive semidefinite.

    If the method produces a square root of the output matrix as a side product, this should be returned
    in addition since many use cases that require a salvaged covariance matrix also require a square root
    of this matrix e.g. for generating correlated normal random variates. A repeated computation of the
    square root can be avoided this way. The returned square root may but is not required to be the
    unique symmetric positive semidefinite sqaure root of the salvaged covariance matrix p.

    If the method does not provide a square root, an empty matrix Matrix() should be returned instead,
    in which case the caller is responsible to compute a square root if required. */
