/*! This market takes a map from Ibor index names to estimation curves and provides the corresponding
    Ibor indices via the market interface.

    In addition (dummy) yield curves, security spreads, default curves and recovery rates are provided, all with
    zero rates.

    This way we can build a Bond against this market and use the underlying QuantLib::Bond instrument to set
    up a BondHelper from which a fitted bond curve can be bootstrapped.
