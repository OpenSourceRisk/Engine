//! Intelligent FX price repository
/*! FX Triangulation is an intelligent price repository that will attempt to calculate FX spot values
 *
 *  As quotes for currency pairs are added to the repository they are stored in an internal map
 *  If the repository is asked for the FX spot price for a given pair it will attempt the following:
 *  1) Look in the map for the pair
 *  2) Look for the reverse quote (EURUSD -> USDEUR), if found it will return an inverse quote.
 *  3) Look through the map and attempt to find a bridging pair (e.g EURUSD and EURJPY for USDJPY)
 *     and return the required composite quote.
 *
 *  In cases (2) and (3) the constructed quote is then stored in the map so subsequent calls will hit (1).
 *
 *  The constructed quotes all reference the original quotes which are added by the addQuote() method
 *  and so if these original quotes change in the future, the constructed quotes will reflect the new
 *  value
 *
