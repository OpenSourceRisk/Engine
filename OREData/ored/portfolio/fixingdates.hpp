        needed. The determination of whether a cashflow has or has not occurred will in general rely on a call to \c

        Another important case is where a cash flow fixing date occurs on the settlement date. In this case, we should

    These additional index and fixing date pairs are found by scanning the \p mktParams and:
    - for MarketObject::IndexCurve, take the ibor index name and add the dates for each weekday between settlement
      date minus \p iborLookback period or \p oisLookback period and settlement date. The distinction between 
      Ibor and OIS is made here to cover the fixings necessary for OIS futures. The default value of 4 months 
      covers OIS futures with a contract period of up to 3 months. It would need to be configured differently 
      if OIS futures with a longer contract period are possible.
    - for MarketObject::ZeroInflationCurve, take the inflation index and add the first of each month between
      settlement date minus \p inflationLookback period and settlement date
    - for MarketObject::YoYInflationCurve, take the inflation index and add the first of each month between
      settlement date minus \p inflationLookback period and settlement date
    - for MarketObject::CommodityCurve, add \e fixings for future contracts expiring 2 months either side of the
      settlement date. The fixing dates are added for each weekday going back to the first day of the month that
      precedes the settlement date by 2 months. The approach here will give rise to some spot commodities being
      given a future contract name and dates added against them - this should not be a problem as there will be
      no fixings found for them in any case.
