    The template parameter is simply a particular instance of a \c LegAdditionalData class that is default
    constructible. The function returns the default constructed LegAdditionalData object. A simple example is the
    function to build an instance of \c FixedLegData would be called via \c createLegData<FixedLegData>().

/*! Leg data factory class

    This class is a repository of functions that can build instances of \c LegAdditionalData. The functions are keyed
    on the leg data type that they can build. An instance of this factory class can be asked to build a particular
    instance of the LegAdditionalData class via a call to <code>build(const std::string& legType)</code> with the
    correct \c legType name. For example, a call to <code>build("Fixed")</code> should return a \c FixedLegData
    instance if the fixed leg data building function has been added to the factory.

    It is up to each class derived from \c LegAdditionalData to register itself with the \c LegDataFactory via the
    \c LegDataRegister class below. All registration does is add a function that can build an instance of that class
    to the factory and store it against its leg type key.
