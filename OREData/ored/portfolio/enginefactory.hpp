//! Base PricingEngine Builder class for a specific model and engine
/*!
 *  The EngineBuilder is responsible for building pricing engines for a specific
 *  Model and Engine.
 *
 *  Each builder should implement a method with a signature
 *  @code
 *  boost::shared_ptr<PricingEngine> engine (...);
 *  @endcode
 *  The exact parameters of each method can vary depending on the type of engine.
 *
 *  An EngineBuilder can cache engines and return the same PricingEngine multiple
 *  times, alternatively the Builder can build a unique PricingEngine each time it
 *  is called.
 *
 *  For example a swap engine builder can have the interface
 *  @code
 *  boost::shared_ptr<PricingEngine> engine (const Currency&);
 *  @endcode
 *  and so returns the same (cached) engine every time it is asked for a particular
 *  currency.
 *
 *  The interface of each type of engine builder can be different, then there can
 *  be further sub-classes for different models and engines.
 *
 *  EngineBuilders are registered in an EngineFactory, multiple engine builders for
 *  the same trade type can be registered with the EngineFactory and it will select
 *  the appropriate one based on configuration.
 *
 *  Each EngineBuilder must return it's Model and Engine.

/*! A Pricing Engine Factory is used when building a portfolio, it provides

 *  The first level is the type of builder (Model and Engine) to use for each
 *  trade type, so given a trade type one asks the factory for a builder and
 *  then the builder for a PricingEngine. Each builder must be registered with
 *  the factory and then the configuration defines which builder to use.
 *
 *  Secondly, the factory maintains builder specific parameters for each Model
 *  and Engine.
