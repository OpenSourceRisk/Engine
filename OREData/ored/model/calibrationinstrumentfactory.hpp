    The template parameter is simply a particular instance of a \c CalibrationInstrument class that is default
    constructible. The function returns the default constructed CalibrationInstrument object. A simple example is the
    function to build an instance of \c CpiCapFloor would be called via \c createLegData<CpiCapFloor>().

/*! Calibration instrument factory class

    This class is a repository of functions that can build instances of \c CalibrationInstrument. The functions are 
    keyed on the calibration instrument type that they can build. An instance of this factory class can be asked to 
    build a particular instance of the CalibrationInstrument class via a call to 
    <code>build(const std::string& instrumentType)</code> with the correct calibration instrument type, 
    \c instrumentType. For example, a call to <code>build("CpiCapFloor")</code> should return a \c CpiCapFloor
    instance if the CpiCapFloor calibration instrument building function has been added to the factory.

    It is up to each class derived from \c CalibrationInstrument to register itself with the 
    \c CalibrationInstrumentFactory via the \c CalibrationInstrumentRegister class below. All registration does is add 
    a function that can build an instance of that class to the factory and store it against its calibration instrument 
    type key.
