//! Pseudo Fixings Manager
/*!
  A Pseudo Fixing is a future historical fixing. When pricing on T0 but asof T and we require a fixing on t with
  T0 < t < T then the QuantLib pricing engines will look to the IndexManager for a fixing at t.

  When moving between dates and simulation paths then the Fixings can change and should be populated in a path
  consistent manner

  The FixingManager controls this updating and reset of the QuantLib::IndexManager for the required set of fixings

  When stepping between simulation dated t_(n-1) and t_(n) and update a fixing t with t_(n-1) < t < t(n) than the fixing
  from t(n) will be backfilled. There is currently no interpolation of fixings.
