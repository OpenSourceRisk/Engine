//! Valuation Engine
/*!
  The valuation engine's purpose is to generate an NPV cube.
  Its buildCube loops over samples->dates->trades and prices the portfolio
  under all samples and dates.

  The number of dates is defined by the DateGrid passed to the constructor.
  The number of trades is defined by the size of the portfolio passed to buildCube().
  The number of samples is defined by the NPVCube that is passed to buildCube(), this
  can be dynamic.

  In addition to storing the resulting NPVs it can be given any number of calculators
  that can store additional values in the cube.
