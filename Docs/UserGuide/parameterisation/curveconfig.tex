%--------------------------------------------------------

The configuration of various term structures required to price a portfolio is covered in a single configuration file
which we will label {\tt curveconfig.xml} in the following though the file name can be chosen by the user. This
configuration determines the composition of 
\begin{itemize}
\item Yield curves % done
\item Default curves % done
\item Inflation curves % done
\item Equity forward price curves % done
\item Swaption volatility structures % done
\item Cap/Floor volatility structures % done
\item FX Option volatility structures % done
\item CDS volatility structures % done
\item Inflation Cap/Floor price surfaces % done
\item Equity volatility structures % done
\item Security spreads and recovery rates % done
\item Base correlation curves % done
\item Correlation termstructures % done
\end{itemize}

This file also contains other market objects such as FXSpots, Security Spreads and Security Rates which are necessary
for the construction of a market.

\item Dimension: Distinguishes at-the-money matrices and full volatility cubes. \\ Allowable values: {\tt ATM, Smile}
\item VolatilityType: Specifies the type of market volatility inputs. \\ 
Allowable values: {\tt Normal, Lognormal, ShiftedLognormal} \\
In the case of {\tt ShiftedLognormal}, a matrix of shifts (by option and swap tenor) has to be provided in the market data input. 
\item Extrapolation: Specifies the extrapolation behaviour in all dimensions. \\ Allowable values: {\tt Linear, Flat, None}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item OptionTenors: Option expiry in period form
  \item SwapTenors: Underlying Swap term in period form
  \item ShortSwapIndexBase: Swap index (ORE naming convention, e.g. EUR-CMS-1Y) used to compute ATM strikes for tenors up to and including the tenor given in the index (1Y in this example)
  \item SwapIndexBase: Swap index used to compute ATM strikes for tenors longer than the one defined by the short index 
  \end{itemize}
\item Smile section specification, this part is required when Dimension is set to {\tt Smile}, otherwise it can be omitted:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item SmileOptionTenors: Option expiries, in period form, where smile section data is to be taken into account

  \end{itemize}
\item QuoteTag [Optional]: If non-empty, a tag will be included in the market datum labels. This can be used to set up
  underlying specific volatility date. For example, if the quote tag is set to EUR-EURIBOR-3M, the market datum labels
  will be \verb+SWAPTION/RATE\_LNVOL/EUR/EUR-EURIBOR-3M/5Y/10Y/ATM+ instead of
  \verb+SWAPTION/RATE\_LNVOL/EUR/5Y/10Y/ATM+.

\end{minted}
\caption{Equity curve configuration}
\label{lst:eqcurve_configuration}
\end{longlisting}

The meaning of each of the elements is given below. 

\begin{itemize}
\item CurveId: Unique identifier of the equity curve structure.
\item CurveDescription [Optional]: A description of the equity curve structure, may be left blank.
\item Currency: Currency of the equity.
\item Calendar [Optional]: The term structure's calendar used in tenor to date conversions. Defaults to the calendar corresponding to \lstinline!Currency!.
\item ForecastingCurve: CurveId of the curve used for discounting equity fixing forecasts.
\item Type: The quote types in \lstinline!Quote! (e.g.\ option premium, forward equity price) and whether dividends are taken into account. Allowable values: {\tt DividendYield, ForwardPrice, ForwardDividendPrice, OptionPremium, NoDividends}
\item ExerciseStyle [Optional]: Exercise type of the underlying option quotes. Only required if \lstinline!Type! is \emph{OptionPremium}. Allowable values: {\tt American, European}
\item SpotQuote: Market datum ID/name of the current spot rate for the equity underlying.
\item Quotes [Optional]: Market datum IDs/names to be used in building the curve structure.
\item DayCounter [Optional]: The term structure's day counter used in date to time conversions. Defaults to {\tt A365F}.
\item DividendInterpolation [Optional]: This node contains an \lstinline!InterpolationVariable! and \lstinline!InterpolationMethod! sub-node, which define the variable on which the interpolation is performed and the interpolation method for the dividend curve, respectively. The allowable values are found in Table \ref{tab:allow_interp_variables} and Table \ref{tab:allow_interp_methods}, respectively. This should not be provided if \lstinline!Type! is {\tt NoDividends}.
\item Extrapolation [Optional]: Boolean flag indicating whether extrapolation is allowed. Defaults to {\tt True}.
\end{itemize}

The equity curves here consists of a spot equity price, as well as a set of either forward prices or else dividend 
yields. If the index is a dividend futures index then curve type should be entered as ForwardDividendPrice. In this case the curve will be built from forward prices as normal, but excluded from the SIMM calculations as required by the SIMM methodology.
Upon construction, ORE stores internally an equity spot price quote, a forecasting curve and a dividend yield 
term structure, which are then used together for projection of forward prices.

\subsubsection{Equity Volatility Structures}

When configuring volatility structures for equities, there are four options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a constant volatility for all expiries and strikes.
\item a volatility curve with a dependency on expiry but no strike dimension.
\item a volatility surface with an expiry and strike dimension.
\item a proxy surface - point to another surface as a proxy.
\end{enumerate}

There are a number of fields common to all configurations:
\begin{itemize}
\item CurveId: Unique identifier for the curve.
\item CurveDescription [Optional]: A description of the curve. This field may be left blank.
\item Currency: Currency of the equity.
\item Calendar [Optional]: allowable value is any valid calendar. Defaults to \lstinline!NullCalendar!.
\item DayCounter [Optional]: allowable value is any valid day counter. Defaults to \lstinline!A365!.
\item OneDimSolverConfig [Optional]: A configuration for the one dimensional solver used in deriving volatilities from prices. This node is described in detail in Section \ref{sec:one_dim_solver_config}. If not provided, a default step based configuration is used. This is only used when volatilities are stripped from prices.
\item PreferOutOfTheMoney [Optional]: allowable value is any boolean value. Defaults to \lstinline!false! for backwards compatibility. It is used, when building the volatility surface, to choose between a call and put option price or volatility when both are provided. When set to \lstinline!true!, the out of the money option is chosen by comparing the quote's strike with the forward price at the associated expiry. Conversely, when set to \lstinline!false!, the in the money option is chosen.
\end{itemize}

Listing \ref{lst:eqoptionvol_constant} shows the configuration of equity volatility structures with constant volatility. A node \lstinline!Constant! takes one \lstinline!Quote!, as described in Section \ref{md:equity_option_iv}, which is held constant for all strikes and expiries.

Secondly, the volatility curve configuration layout is given in Listing \ref{lst:eqoptionvol_curve}. With this curve construction the volatility is held constant in the strike direction, and quotes of varying expiry can be provided, for examlple if only ATM volatility quotes are available. The volatility quote IDs in the \lstinline!Quotes! node should be Equity option volatility quotes as described in Section \ref{md:equity_option_iv}. An explicit list of quotes can be provided, or a single quote with a wildcard replacing the expiry/strike. In the wildcard case, it will look for any matching quotes provided in the loader, and construct the curve from these. The \lstinline!Interpolation! node supports \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!Cubic! and \lstinline!LogLinear! interpolation. The \lstinline!Extrapolation! node supports either \lstinline!None! for no extrapolation or \lstinline!Flat! for flat extrapolation in the volatility.

\end{longlisting}

The volatility strike surface configuration layout is given in Listing \ref{lst:eqoptionvol_surface}. This allows a full surface of \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! to be defined. The following are the valid nodes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\lstinline!QuoteType!: either \lstinline!ImpliedVolatility! of \lstinline!Premium!, indicating the type of quotes provided in the market.

\item
\lstinline!ExerciseType! [Optional]: only valid when \lstinline!QuoteType! is \lstinline!Premium!. Valid types are \lstinline!European! and \lstinline!American!.

\item
\lstinline!VolatilityType! [Optional]: only valid when \lstinline!QuoteType! is \lstinline!ImpliedVolatility!. Valid types are \lstinline!Lognormal!, \lstinline!ShiftedLognormal! and \lstinline!Normal!.

\item
\lstinline!Strikes!: comma separated list of strikes, representing the absolute strike values for the option. In other words, A single wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, can be used here also to indicate that all strikes found in the market data for this equity volatility configuration should be used when building the equity volatility surface.

\item
\lstinline!Expiries!: comma separated list of expiry tenors and or expiry dates. A single wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, can be used here also to indicate that all expiries found in the market data for this equity volatility configuration should be used when building the equity volatility surface.

\item
\lstinline!TimeInterpolation!: interpolation in the option expiry direction. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear! is used. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!Cubic! is allowed here but the value must agree with the value for \lstinline!StrikeInterpolation!.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeInterpolation!: interpolation in the strike direction. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear! is used. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!Cubic! is allowed here but the value must agree with the value for \lstinline!TimeInterpolation!.

\item
\lstinline!Extrapolation!: boolean value. If \lstinline!true!, extrapolation is allowed. If \lstinline!false!, extrapolation is not allowed.

\item
\lstinline!TimeExtrapolation!: extrapolation in the option expiry direction. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, the extrapolation in the time direction is flat in volatility regardless of the setting here. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!UseInterpolator!, \lstinline!Flat! or \lstinline!None! are allowed. If \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!UseInterpolator! is specified, the extrapolation is linear. If \lstinline!Flat! is specified, the extrapolation is flat. If \lstinline!None! is specified, it is ignored and the extrapolation is flat since extrapolation in the time direction cannot be turned off in isolation i.e.\ extrapolation can only be turned off for the surface as a whole using the \lstinline!Extrapolation! flag.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeExtrapolation!: extrapolation in the strike direction. The allowable values are \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!UseInterpolator!, \lstinline!Flat! or \lstinline!None!. If \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!UseInterpolator! is specified, the extrapolation uses the strike interpolation setting for extrapolation i.e. linear or cubic in this case. If \lstinline!Flat! is specified, the extrapolation is flat. If \lstinline!None! is specified, it is ignored and the extrapolation is flat since extrapolation in the strike direction cannot be turned off in isolation i.e.\ extrapolation can only be turned off for the surface as a whole using the \lstinline!Extrapolation! flag.

\end{itemize}

When this configuration is used, the market is searched for quote strings of the form \lstinline!EQUITY_OPTION/PRICE/[NAME]/[CURRENCY]/[EXPIRY]/[STRIKE]! or \lstinline!EQUITY_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[CURRENCY]/[EXPIRY]/[STRIKE]!, depending on the \lstinline!QuoteType!. When both the \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, it is clear that the \lstinline![EXPIRY]! field is populated from the list of expiries in turn and the \lstinline![STRIKE]! field is populated from the list of strikes in turn. If there are $m$ expiries in the \lstinline!Expiries! list and $n$ strikes in the \lstinline!Strikes! list, there will be $m \times n$ quotes created and searched for in the market data. If \lstinline!Expiries! are configured via the wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, all quotes in the market data matching the pattern \lstinline!EQUITY_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[CURRENCY]/*/[STRIKE]!. Similarly for \lstinline!Strikes! configured via the wildcard character, \lstinline!*!.

A volatility surface can also be given in terms of moneyness levels as shown in listing
\ref{lst:eqoptionvol_mny_surface}. The nodes have the same meaning as in the case of a strike surface with the following
exceptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline!QuoteType!: only \lstinline!ImpliedVolatility! is allowed
\item \lstinline!VolatilityType! [Optional]: only \lstinline!Lognormal! is allowed
\item \lstinline!MoneynessType!: \lstinline!Spot! or \lstinline!Fwd!, indicating the type of moneyness. See
  \ref{md:equity_option_iv} for the definition of moneyness types.
\item \lstinline!MoneynessLevels!: comma separated list of moneyness levels, no wild cards are allowed.
\item \lstinline!Expiries!: comma separated list of expiry tenors and or expiry dates. A single wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, can be used here also to indicate that all expiries found in the market data for this equity volatility configuration should be used when building the equity volatility surface.
\end{itemize}

Notice that the market data for the moneyness level $1.0$ must be given as a moneyness quote, not an ATM or ATMF quote,
see \ref{md:equity_option_iv} for details of the market data.

Finally, the volatility proxy surface configuration layout is given in Listing \ref{lst:eqoptionvol_proxy}. This allows us to use any other surface as a proxy, in cases where there is no option data for a given equity. We provide a name in the \lstinline!EquityVolatilityCurve! field, which must match the \lstinline!CurveId! of another configuration.  \lstinline!FXVolatilityCurve! and \lstinline!CorrelationCurve! must be provided if the currency of the proxy surface is different to that of current surface, that can be omitted otherwise. The proxy surface looks up the volatility in the reference surface based on moneyness.

\caption{Inflation Curve Configuration}
\label{lst:inflationcurve_configuration}
\end{longlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt NominalTermStructure}: The interest rate curve to be used to strip the inflation curve.
\item {\tt Type}: The type of the curve, {\tt ZC} for zero coupon, {\tt YY} for year on year.
\item {\tt Quotes}: The instruments' market quotes from which to bootstrap the curve.
\item {\tt Conventions}: The conventions applicable to the curve instruments.
\item {\tt Lag}: The observation lag used in the term structure.
\item {\tt Frequency}: The frequency of index fixings.
\item {\tt BaseRate}: The rate at $t=0$, this introduces an additional degree of freedom to get a smoother curve. If not
  given, it is defaulted to the first market rate.
\end{itemize}

The optional seasonality block defines a multiplicative seasonality and contains the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt BaseDate}: Defines the first inflation period to which to apply the seasonality correction, only day and
  month matters, the year is ignored.
\item {\tt Frequency:} Defines the frequency of the factors (usually identical to the index's fixing frequency).
\item {\tt Factors:} Multiplicative seasonality correction factors, must be part of the market data.
\item {\tt OverrideFactors:} A numeric list of seasonality correction factors, replacing the Factors. This allows to
  specify a static seasonality correction that does not require market data quotes. If both Factors and OverrideFactors
  are given, the OverrideFactors are used. Otherwise only one of Factors, OverrideFactors is required in a seasonality
  block.
\end{itemize}

We note that if zero coupon swap market quotes are given, but the type is set to YY, the zero coupon swap quotes will be
converted to year on year swap quotes on the fly, using the plain forward rates, i.e. no convexity adjustment is
applied.

\end{minted}
\caption{Inflation ZC cap floor volatility surface configuration}
\label{lst:inflationcapfloorvolsurface_configuration}
\end{longlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt Type}: The type of the surface, {\tt ZC} for zero coupon, {\tt YY} for year on year. 
\item {\tt QuoteType}: The type of the quotes used to build the surface, {\tt Volatility} for volatility quotes, {\tt Price} for bootstrap from option premia. 
\item {\tt VolatilityType}: If QuoteType is {\tt Volatility}, this specifies whether the input is {\tt Normal}, {\tt Lognormal} or {\tt ShiftedLognormal}. 
\item {\tt Extrapolation}: Boolean to indicate whether the surface should allow extrapolation. 
\item {\tt DayCounter}: The term structure's day counter
\item {\tt Calendar}: The term structure's calendar 
\item {\tt BusinessDayConvention}: The term structure's business day convention
\item {\tt Tenors:} The maturities for which cap and floor prices are quoted
\item {\tt Strikes}: In the case of QuoteType {\tt Volatility}, the strikes for which floor prices are quoted (may, and will usually, overlap with the cap
  strike region); neither CapStrikes nor FloorStrikes are expected in this case. 
\item {\tt CapStrikes}: The strikes for which cap prices are quoted (may, and will usually, overlap with the floor
  strike region); if the QuoteType above is {\tt Price}, either CapStrikes or FloorStrikes or both are required.
\item {\tt FloorStrikes}: The strikes for which floor prices are quoted (may and will usually) overlap with the cap
  strike region); if the QuoteType above is {\tt Price}, either CapStrikes or FloorStrikes or both are required. 
\item {\tt Index}: The underlying zero inflation index.
\item {\tt IndexCurve}: The curve id of the index's projection curve used to determine the ATM levels for the surface.
\item {\tt IndexInterpolated}: Flag indicating whether the index should be interpolating.
\item {\tt Observation Lag}: The observation lag applicable to the term structure.
\item {\tt YieldTermStructure}: The nominal term structure.
\item \lstinline!QuoteIndex!: An optional node allowing the user to provide an alternative index name for forming the quotes that will be used in building the cap floor surface. If this node is not provided, the \lstinline!Index! node value is used in quote construction. For example, quotes must be created from each strike and each tenor and these quotes are subsequently looked up in the market data when building the cap floor volatility surface. The quotes are formed by concatenating \lstinline![Type]_INFLATIONCAPFLOOR!, \lstinline!PRICE! or \lstinline!RATE_[Vol_Type]VOL!, \lstinline![Index_Name]!, \lstinline![Tenor]!, \lstinline!C! or \lstinline!F! and \lstinline![Strike]! delimited by \lstinline!/!. If \lstinline!QuoteIndex! is provided, it is used as the \lstinline![Index_Name]! token. If it is not provided \lstinline!Index! is used as usual.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{CDS Volatilities}

When configuring volatility structures for CDS and index CDS options, there are three options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a constant volatility for all expiries, strikes and terms.
\item a volatility curve with a dependency on expiry and term, but no strike dimension.
\item a volatility surface with an expiry, term and strike dimension.
\end{enumerate}

Firstly, the constant volatility configuration layout is given in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_constant_config}. The single volatility quote ID, \lstinline!constant_quote_id!, in the \lstinline!Quote! node should be a CDS option volatility quote as described in Section \ref{md:cds_option_iv}. The \lstinline!DayCounter! node is optional and defaults to \lstinline!A365F!. The \lstinline!Calendar! node is optional and defaults to \lstinline!NullCalendar!. The \lstinline!DayCounter! and \lstinline!Calendar! nodes are common to all three CDS volatility configurations.

\begin{longlisting}

  <Calendar>...</Calendar>
</CDSVolatility>
\end{minted}
\caption{Constant CDS volatility configuration}
\label{lst:cdsvol_constant_config}
\end{longlisting}

Secondly, the volatility curve configuration layout is given in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_curve_config}. The volatility quote IDs, \lstinline!quote_id_1!, \lstinline!quote_id_2!, etc., in the \lstinline!Quotes! node should be CDS option volatility quotes as described in Section \ref{md:cds_option_iv}. The \lstinline!Interpolation! node supports \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!Cubic! and \lstinline!LogLinear! interpolation. The \lstinline!Extrapolation! node supports either \lstinline!None! for no extrapolation or \lstinline!Flat! for flat extrapolation in the volatility.

The optional boolean parameter \lstinline!EnforceMontoneVariance! should be set to \lstinline!true! to raise an exception if the curve implied variance is not montone increasing with time and should be set to \lstinline!false! if you want to suppress such an exception. The default value for \lstinline!EnforceMontoneVariance! is \lstinline!true!.

\end{minted}
\caption{CDS volatility curve configuration}
\label{lst:cdsvol_curve_config}
\end{longlisting}

For backwards compatibility, the volatility curve configuration can also be given using a single \lstinline!Expiries! node as shown in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_curve_config_alt}. Note that this configuration is deprecated and the configuration in \ref{lst:cdsvol_curve_config} is preferred. The \lstinline!Expiries! node should take a comma separated list of tenors and or expiry dates e.g.\ \lstinline!<Expiries>1M,3M,6M</Expiries>!. The list of expiries are extracted and a set of quotes are created of the form \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[EXPIRY]! or \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[TERM]/[EXPIRY]!. There is one quote for each expiry in the list where the \lstinline![EXPIRY]! field is understood to be replaced with the expiry string extracted from the list.

The \lstinline![NAME]! field is populated with the curve id or with the \lstinline![QuoteName]! if that is specified. The rules for including market quotes into the volatility surface construction are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item All quotes explicitly specified with their full name are loaded (applies to configs of type constant or curve
  without wildcards)
\item If a quote does not contain a term, we only load it if at most one term is specified in the vol curve config. The
  quote gets the unique term specified in the vol curve configs assigned or 5Y if the config does not specify any terms.
\item If a quote contains a term if this matches one of the configured terms in the curve configuration or if the curve
  configuration does not specify any terms.
\end{itemize}

The \lstinline![Terms]! node specifies a list of term labels ``5Y'', ``7Y'', ... and associated credit curve spec names
representing the curve suitable to estimate the ATM level for that term.

If only one expiry is provided in the list, there is only one quote and a constant volatility structure is configured as in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_constant_config}. If more than one expiry is provided, a curve is configured as in \ref{lst:cdsvol_curve_config}. The interpolation is \lstinline!Linear!, the extrapolation is \lstinline!Flat! and \lstinline!EnforceMontoneVariance! is \lstinline!true!.

\label{lst:cdsvol_curve_config_alt}
\end{longlisting}

Thirdly, the volatility surface configuration layout is given in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_surface_config}. The nodes have the following meanings and supported values:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\lstinline!Strikes!: comma separated list of strikes. The strikes may be in terms of spread or price. However, it is important to ensure that the trade XML for a CDS option or index CDS option provides the strike in the same way. In other words, if the strike is in terms of spread on the trade XML, the strike must be in terms of spread in the CDS volatility configuration here. Similarly for strikes in terms of price. A single wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, can be used here also to indicate that all strikes found in the market data for this CDS volatility configuration should be used when building the CDS volatility surface.

\item
\lstinline!Expiries!: comma separated list of expiry tenors and or expiry dates. A single wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, can be used here also to indicate that all expiries found in the market data for this CDS volatility configuration should be used when building the CDS volatility surface.

\item
\lstinline!TimeInterpolation!: interpolation in the option expiry direction. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear! is used. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!Cubic! is allowed here but the value must agree with the value for \lstinline!StrikeInterpolation!.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeInterpolation!: interpolation in the strike direction. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear! is used. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!Cubic! is allowed here but the value must agree with the value for \lstinline!TimeInterpolation!.

\item
\lstinline!Extrapolation!: boolean value. If \lstinline!true!, extrapolation is allowed. If \lstinline!false!, extrapolation is not allowed.

\item
\lstinline!TimeExtrapolation!: extrapolation in the option expiry direction. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, the extrapolation in the time direction is flat in volatility regardless of the setting here. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!UseInterpolator!, \lstinline!Flat! or \lstinline!None! are allowed. If \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!UseInterpolator! is specified, the extrapolation is linear. If \lstinline!Flat! is specified, the extrapolation is flat. If \lstinline!None! is specified, it is ignored and the extrapolation is flat since extrapolation in the time direction cannot be turned off in isolation i.e.\ extrapolation can only be turned off for the surface as a whole using the \lstinline!Extrapolation! flag.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeExtrapolation!: extrapolation in the strike direction. The allowable values are \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!UseInterpolator!, \lstinline!Flat! or \lstinline!None!. If \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!UseInterpolator! is specified, the extrapolation uses the strike interpolation setting for extrapolation i.e. linear or cubic in this case. If \lstinline!Flat! is specified, the extrapolation is flat. If \lstinline!None! is specified, it is ignored and the extrapolation is flat since extrapolation in the strike direction cannot be turned off in isolation i.e.\ extrapolation can only be turned off for the surface as a whole using the \lstinline!Extrapolation! flag.

\item
\lstinline!DayCounter!: allowable value is any valid day count fraction. As stated above, this node is optional and defaults to \lstinline!A365F!.

\item
\lstinline!Calendar!: allowable value is any valid calendar. As stated above, this node is optional and defaults to \lstinline!NullCalendar!.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeType!: allowable value is either \lstinline!Price! or \lstinline!Spread!. This flag denotes if the strikes are in terms of spread or price. Currently, this is merely informational and as outlined in the \lstinline!Strikes! section above, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the strike type in trades aligns with the configured strike type in the CDS volatility surfaces.

\item
\lstinline!QuoteName!: this node is optional and the allowable value is any string. This value can be used in determining the name and term that appears in the quote strings that are searched for in the market data to feed into the CDS volatility surface construction. How it is used has been outlined above when describing the deprecated CDS volatility curve configuration.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeFactor!: this node is optional and the allowable value is any positive real number. It defaults to 1. The strikes configured and found in the market data quote strings may not be in absolute terms. For example, a quote string such as \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/CDXIGS33V1/5Y/1M/115! could be given to indicate an index CDS option volatility quote for CDX IG Series 33 Version 1, with underlying index term 5Y expiring in 1M with a strike spread of 115 bps. The strike here is in bps and needs to be divided by 10,000 before being used in the ORE volatility objects. The \lstinline!StrikeFactor! would be set to \lstinline!10000! here.

\end{itemize}

When the CDS volatility surface is configured as in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_surface_config}, the market is searched for quote strings of the form \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[EXPIRY]/[STRIKE]! or \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[TERM]/[EXPIRY]/[STRIKE]!. The population of the \lstinline![NAME]! field, and possibly the \lstinline![TERM]! field, and how they depend on the \lstinline!QuoteName! and \lstinline!ParseTerm! nodes has been discussed at length above when describing the deprecated CDS volatility curve configuration. When both the \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, it is clear that the \lstinline![EXPIRY]! field is populated from the list of expiries in turn and the \lstinline![STRIKE]! field is populated from the list of strikes in turn. If there are $m$ expiries in the \lstinline!Expiries! list and $n$ strikes in the \lstinline!Strikes! list, there will be $m \times n$ quotes created and searched for in the market data. If \lstinline!Expiries! are configured via the wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, all quotes in the market data matching the pattern \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/*/[STRIKE]! will be used if \lstinline![TERM]! has not been populated and all quotes in the market data matching the pattern \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[TERM]/*/[STRIKE]! will be used if \lstinline![TERM]! has been populated. Similarly for \lstinline!Strikes! configured via the wildcard character, \lstinline!*!.

The meaning of each of the elements in Listing \ref{lst:basecorr_configuration} is given below. 

\begin{itemize}
\item CurveId: Unique identifier of the base correlation structure
\item CurveDescription [Optional]: A description of the base correlation structure, may be left blank.
\item Terms: Comma-separated list of tenors, sorted in increasing order, possibly a single term to represent a flat term structure in time-direction
\item DetachmentPoints: Comma-separated list of equity tranche detachment points, sorted in increasing order\\
Allowable values: Any positive number less than one

\item Extrapolate: Boolean to indicate whether the correlation curve shall be extrapolated or not
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{FXSpots}

Listing \ref{lst:fxspot_configuration} shows the configuration of the fxSpots. It is assumed that each FXSpot CurveId is of
the form "Ccy1Ccy2".

\subsubsection{Securities}

Listing \ref{lst:security_configuration} shows the configuration of the Securities. Each Security name is associated with

\begin{itemize}
\item an optional SpreadQuote
\item an optional RecoveryRateQuote. Usually a pricer will fall back on the recovery rate associated to the credit curve
  involved in the pricing if no security specific recovery rate is given. If no credit curve is given either, a zero
  recovery rate will be assumed.
\end{itemize}

If no configuration is given for a security, in general a pricer will assume as zero spread and recovery rate. Notice
that in this case the spread and recovery will not be simulated and therefore also be excluded from the sensitivity and
stress analysis.

\begin{longlisting}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}

\end{minted}
\caption{Security Configuration}

\subsubsection{Correlations}

Listing \ref{lst:correlation_configuration} shows the configuration of the Correlations. The Correlation type can be either CMSSpread or Generic. The former one is to configure the correlation between two CMS indexes, the latter one is to  generally configure the correlation between two indexes, e.g. between a CMS index and a IBOR index. Currently only ATM correlation curves or Flat correlation structures are supported. Correlation quotes may be loaded directly (by setting QuoteType to RATE) or calibrated from prices (set QuoteType to PRICE).  Moreover a flat zero correlation curve can be loaded (by setting  QuoteType to NULL). In this case market quotes are not needed to be provided. Currently only CMSSpread correlations can be calibrated. This is done using CMS Spread Options, and requires a CMSSpreadOption convention, SwaptionVolatility and DiscountCurve to be provided. OptionTenors can be a comma separated list of periods, 1Y,2Y etc, or a \lstinline!*! to indicate a wildcard. If a wildcard is provided, all relevant market data quotes are used.

\subsubsection{Bootstrap Configuration}
\label{sec:bootstrap_config}
The \lstinline!BootstrapConfig! node, outlined in listing \ref{lst:bootstrap_config_outline}, can be added to curve configurations that use a bootstrap algorithm to alter the default behaviour of the bootstrap algorithm.

\begin{longlisting}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<BootstrapConfig>
  <Accuracy>...</Accuracy>
  <GlobalAccuracy>...</GlobalAccuracy>
  <DontThrow>...</DontThrow>
  <MaxAttempts>...</MaxAttempts>
  <MaxFactor>...</MaxFactor>
  <MinFactor>...</MinFactor>
  <DontThrowSteps>...</DontThrowSteps>
</BootstrapConfig>
\end{minted}
\caption{\lstinline!BootstrapConfig! node outline}
\label{lst:bootstrap_config_outline}
\end{longlisting}

The meaning of each of the elements is:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline!Accuracy! [Optional]:
The accuracy with which the implied quote must match the market quote for each instrument in the curve bootstrap. This node should hold a positive real number. If omitted, the default value is \num[scientific-notation=true]{1.0e-12}.

\item \lstinline!GlobalAccuracy! [Optional]:
If the interpolation method in the bootstrap is global, e.g. cubic spline, the bootstrap routine needs to perform multiple iterative bootstraps of the curve to converge. After each such bootstrap of the full curve, the absolute value of the change between the current bootstrap and previous bootstrap for the curve value at each pillar is calculated. The global bootstrap is deemed to have converged if the maximum of these changes is less than the global accuracy or the accuracy from the \lstinline!Accuracy! node. This node should hold a positive real number. If omitted, the global accuracy is set equal to the accuracy from the \lstinline!Accuracy! node. This node is useful in some cases where a slightly less restrictive accuracy, than that given by the \lstinline!Accuracy! node, is needed for the global bootstrap.

\item \lstinline!DontThrow! [Optional]:
If this node is set to \lstinline!true!, the curve bootstrap does not throw an error when the bootstrap fails at a pillar. Instead, a curve value is sought at the failing pillar that minimises the absolute value of the difference between the implied quote and the market quote at that pillar. The minimum is sought between the minimum and maximum curve value that was used in the root finding routine that failed at the pillar. The number of steps used in this search is given by the \lstinline!DontThrowSteps! node below. This node should hold a boolean value. If omitted, the default value is \lstinline!false! i.e. the bootstrap throws an exception at the first pillar where the bootstrap fails.

\item \lstinline!MaxAttempts! [Optional]:
At each pillar, the bootstrap routine searches between a minimum curve value and a maximum curve value for a curve value that gives an implied quote that matches the market quote at that pillar. In some cases, the minimum curve value and maximum curve value are too restrictive and the bootstrap fails at a pillar. This node determines how many times the bootstrap should be attempted at each pillar. For example, if the node is set to 1, the bootstrap uses the minimum curve value and maximum curve value implied in the code and fails if a root is not found. If this node is set to 2 and the first attempt fails, the minimum curve value is reduced by a factor specified in the node \lstinline!MinFactor!, the maximum curve value is increased by a factor specified in the node \lstinline!MaxFactor! and a second attempt is made to find a root between the enlarged bounds. If no root is found, the bootstrap then fails at this pillar. This node should hold a positive integer. If omitted, the default value is 5.

\item \lstinline!MaxFactor! [Optional]:
This node is used only if \lstinline!MaxAttempts! is greater than 1. The meaning of this node is given in the description of the \lstinline!MaxAttempts! node. This node should hold a positive real number. If omitted, the default value is 2.0.

\item \lstinline!MinFactor! [Optional]:
This node is used only if \lstinline!MaxAttempts! is greater than 1. The meaning of this node is given in the description of the \lstinline!MaxAttempts! node. This node should hold a positive real number. If omitted, the default value is 2.0.

\item \lstinline!DontThrowSteps! [Optional]:
This node is used only if \lstinline!DontThrow! is \lstinline!true!. The meaning of this node is given in the description of the \lstinline!DontThrow! node. This node should hold a positive integer. If omitted, the default value is 10.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{One Dimensional Solver Configuration}
\label{sec:one_dim_solver_config}
The \lstinline!OneDimSolverConfig! node, outlined in Listing \ref{lst:one_dim_solver_config_outline}, can be added to certain curve configurations that lead to a one dimensional solver being used in the curve construction. For example, the \lstinline!EquityVolatility! curve configuration can lead to equity volatilities being stripped from equity option premiums. In this case, the \lstinline!OneDimSolverConfig! node can be added to the \lstinline!EquityVolatility! curve configuration to indicate how the solver should behave i.e.\ maximum number of evaluations, initial guess, accuracy etc. The various options are outlined below.

\begin{longlisting}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<OneDimSolverConfig>
  <MaxEvaluations>...</MaxEvaluations>
  <InitialGuess>...</InitialGuess>
  <Accuracy>...</Accuracy>
  <MinMax>
    <Min>...</Min>
    <Max>...</Max>
  </MinMax>
  <!-- Step only needed if MinMax not provided. -->
  <Step>...</Step>
  <LowerBound>...</LowerBound>
  <UpperBound>...</UpperBound>
</OneDimSolverConfig>
\end{minted}
\caption{\lstinline!OneDimSolverConfig! node outline}
\label{lst:one_dim_solver_config_outline}
\end{longlisting}

The meaning of each of the elements is:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline!MaxEvaluations!:
This node should hold a positive integer. The maximum number of function evaluations that can be made by the solver.

\item \lstinline!InitialGuess!:
This node should hold a real number. The initial guess used by the solver.

\item \lstinline!Accuracy!:
This node should hold a positive real number. The accuracy used by the solver in the root find.

\item \lstinline!MinMax! [Optional]:
A node that holds a \lstinline!Min! and a \lstinline!Max! node each of which should hold a real number. This indicates that the solver should search for a root between the value in \lstinline!Min! and the value in \lstinline!Max!. The value in \lstinline!Min! should obviously be less than the value in \lstinline!Max!. This node is optional. If not provided, the \lstinline!Step! node below should be provided to set up a step based solver.

\item \lstinline!Step! [Optional]:
This node should hold a real number. The validation is a choice between \lstinline!MinMax! and \lstinline!Step! so that \lstinline!Step! can only be provided if \lstinline!MinMax! is not and vice versa. The value in \lstinline!Step! provides the solver with a step size to use in its search for a root.

\item \lstinline!LowerBound! [Optional]:
This node should hold a real number. It provides a lower bound for the search domain. If omitted, no lower bound is applied to the search domain.

\item \lstinline!UpperBound! [Optional]:
This node should hold a real number. It provides an upper bound for the search domain. If omitted, no upper bound is applied to the search domain. Obviously, if both \lstinline!LowerBound! and \lstinline!UpperBound! are provided, the value in \lstinline!LowerBound! should be less than the value in \lstinline!UpperBound!.

\end{itemize}
