\section{Introduction}

The {\em Open Source Risk Project} \cite{ORE} aims at providing a transparent platform for pricing and risk analysis
that serves as
%\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\item a benchmarking, validation, training, and teaching reference,
\item an extensible foundation for tailored risk solutions.
\end{itemize}

Its main software project is {\em Open Source Risk Engine} (ORE), an application that provides
\begin{itemize}
\item a Monte Carlo simulation framework for contemporary risk analytics and value adjustments
\item simple interfaces for trade data, market data and system configuration
\item simple launchers and result visualisation in Jupyter, Excel, LibreOffice
\item unit tests and various examples.  
\end{itemize}
ORE is open source software, provided under the Modified BSD License. It is based 
on QuantLib, the open source library for quantitative finance \cite{QL}.

%\medskip
\subsubsection*{Audience}
The project aims at reaching quantitative risk ma\-nage\-ment practitioners (be it in financial institutions, audit
firms, consulting companies or regulatory bodies) who are looking for accessible software solutions, and quant
developers in charge of the implementation of pricing and risk methods similar to those in ORE. Moreover, the project
aims at reaching academics and students who would like to teach or learn quantitative risk management using a freely
available, contemporary risk application.

\subsubsection*{Contributions}
Quaternion Risk Management \cite{QRM} has been committed to sponsoring the Open Source Risk project through ongoing project
administration, through providing an initial release and a series of subsequent releases in order to achieve a wide
analytics, product and risk factor class coverage. Since Quaternion's acquisition by Acadia Inc. in February 2021, Acadia \cite{acadia} is committed to continue the sponsorship. The Open Source Risk project works will continue with former Quaternion now operating as Acadia's Quantitative Services unit. 

The community is invited to contribute to ORE, for example through
feedback, discussions and suggested enhancement in the forum on the ORE site \cite{ORE}, as well as contributions of ORE
enhancements in the form of source code. See the FAQ section on the ORE site \cite{ORE} on how to get involved.

\subsubsection*{Scope and Roadmap}

ORE currently provides portfolio pricing, cash flow generation, sensitivity analysis, stress testing and a range of contemporary derivative portfolio analytics. The latter are based on a Monte Carlo simulation framework which yields 
the evolution of various {\bf credit exposure} measures:
\begin{itemize}
\item EE aka EPE (Expected Exposure or Expected Positive Exposure)
\item ENE (Expected Negative Exposure, i.e. the counterparty's perspective)
\item 'Basel' exposure measures relevant for regulatory capital charges under internal model methods 
\item PFE (Potential Future Exposure at some user defined quantile)
%\item Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall
\end{itemize}
and {\bf derivative value adjustments}
\begin{itemize}
\item CVA (Credit Value Adjustment)
\item DVA (Debit Value Adjustment)
\item FVA (Funding Value Adjustment)
\item COLVA (Collateral Value Adjustment)
\item MVA (Margin Value Adjustment)
\end{itemize}
for portfolios with netting, variation and initial margin agreements. 

\medskip
The sensitivity framework yields further {\bf market risk measures} such as ORE's parametric Value at Risk which takes deltas, vegas, gammas and cross gammas into account. This may be used to benchmark initial margin models such ISDA's Standard Initial Margin Model. \\

\medskip
Subsequent ORE releases will also compute {\bf regulatory capital charges} for counterparty credit risk under the new standardised approach (SA-CCR), and the Monte Carlo based market risk measures will be complemented by parametric methods, e.g. for benchmarking various initial margin calculation models applied in cleared and non-cleared derivatives business.

\medskip 
%The first release of ORE in October 2016 covers the simulation of interest rate and FX risk factors and
%portfolios of Interest Rate Swaps, Caps/Floors, Swaptions, FX Forwards, Cross Currency Swaps and FX Options. Subsequent
%releases from Q1 2017 onwards will extend the derivative product and the risk factor range to Inflation, Credit, Equity
%and Commodity. With the introduction of credit risk factors, the scope will also be extended to cover cash products
%(loans and bonds) and related portfolio analytics.
The product coverage of the seventh release of ORE in September 2022 is sketched in Table \ref{tab_coverage}.

\label{tab_coverage}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Future releases will further extend the product range and analytics coverage indicated in the table above, expand on the market risk analytics, add integrated credit/market risk analytics. 

\medskip The simulation models applied in ORE's risk factor evolution implement the models discussed in detail in {\em
  Modern Derivatives Pricing and Credit Exposure Analysis} \cite{Lichters}: The IR/FX/INF/EQ risk factor evolution is based on
a cross currency model consisting of an arbitrage free combination of Linear Gauss Markov models for all interest rates
and lognormal processes for FX rates and EQ prices, Dodgson-Kainth (or Jarrow-Yildirim) models for inflation. The model components are calibrated to cross currency discounting and forward curves, Swaptions, FX Options, EQ Options and CPI caps/floors. With the 8th release, Commodity simulation has been added, as well as the foundation for a multi-factor Hull-White based IR/FX/COM simulation model.

\subsubsection*{Organisation of this document}

This document focuses on instructions how to use ORE to cover basic workflows from individual deal analysis to portfolio
processing. After an overview over the core ORE data flow in section \ref{sec:process} and installation instructions in
section \ref{sec:installation} we start in section \ref{sec:examples} with a series of examples that illustrate how to
launch ORE using its command line application, and we discuss typical results and reports. We then illustrate in section
\ref{sec:visualisation} interactive analysis of resulting 'NPV cube' data. The final sections of this text document ORE
parametrisation and the structure of trade and market data input.

\end{itemize}

%========================================================
\section{ORE Data Flow}\label{sec:process}
%========================================================

The core processing steps followed in ORE to produce risk analytics results are sketched in Figure \ref{fig_process}.
All ORE calculations and outputs are generated in three fundamental process steps as indicated in the three boxes in the
upper part of the figure. In each of these steps appropriate data (described below) is loaded and results are generated,
either in the form of a human readable report, or in an intermediate step as pure data files (e.g. NPV data, exposure data).
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{process.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Sketch of the ORE process, inputs and outputs. }
\label{fig_process}
\end{figure}

The overall ORE process needs to be parametrised using a set of configuration XML files which is the subject of section
\ref{sec:configuration}. The portfolio is provided in XML format which is explained in detail in sections
\ref{sec:portfolio_data} and \ref{sec:nettingsetinput}. Note that ORE comes with 'Schema' files for all supported
products so that any portfolio xml file can be validated before running through ORE. Market data is provided in a simple
three-column text file with unique human-readable labelling of market data points, as explained in section
\ref{sec:market_data}.  \\

The first processing step (upper left box) then comprises 
\begin{itemize}
\item loading the portfolio to be analysed, 
\item building any yield curves or other 'term structures' needed for pricing, 
\item calibration of pricing and simulation models.
\end{itemize}

The second processing step (upper middle box) is then 
\begin{itemize}
\item portfolio valuation, cash flow generation,
\item going forward - conventional risk analysis such as sensitivity analysis and stress testing, standard-rule capital
  calculations such as SA-CCR, etc,
\item and in particular, more time-consuming, the market simulation and portfolio valuation through time under Monte
  Carlo scenarios.
\end{itemize}
This process step produces several reports (NPV, cashflows etc) and in particular an {\bf NPV cube}, i.e. NPVs per
trade, scenario and future evaluation date. The cube is written to a file in both condensed binary and human-readable
text format.  \\

The third processing step (upper right box) performs more 'sophisticated' risk ana\-ly\-sis by post-processing the NPV
cube data:
\begin{itemize}
\item aggregating over trades per netting set, 
\item applying collateral rules to compute simulated variation margin as well as simulated (dynamic) initial margin
  posting,
\item computing various XVAs including CVA, DVA, FVA, MVA for all netting sets, with and without taking collateral
  (variation and initial margin) into account, on demand with allocation to the trade level.
\end{itemize}
The outputs of this process step are XVA reports and the 'net' NPV cube, i.e. after aggregation, netting and collateral. \\

The example section \ref{sec:examples} demonstrates for representative product types how the described processing steps
can be combined in a simple batch process which produces the mentioned reports, output files and exposure evolution
graphs in one 'go'.

Moreover, both NPV cubes can be further analysed interactively using a visualisation tool introduced in section
\ref{sec:jupyter}. And finally, sections \ref{sec:calc} and \ref{sec:excel} demonstrate how ORE processes can be
launched in spreadsheets and key results presented automatically within the same sheet.

%========================================================
\section{Getting and Building ORE}\label{sec:installation}
%========================================================

You can get ORE in two ways, either by downloading a release bundle as described in section \ref{sec:release} (easiest if you just want to use ORE) or by
checking out the source code from the github repository as described in section \ref{sec:build_ore} (easiest if you want to build and develop ORE).

\subsection{ORE Releases}\label{sec:release}

ORE releases are regularly provided in the form of source code archives, Windows exe\-cutables {\tt ore.exe}, example
cases and documentation. Release archives will be provided at \url{https://github.com/opensourcerisk/engine/releases}.

The release contains the QuantLib source version that ORE depends on. This is the latest QuantLib release that precedes the ORE release including a small number of patches.

\medskip
The release consists of a single archive in zip format
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ORE-<VERSION>.zip}
\end{itemize}

When unpacked, it creates a directory {\tt ORE-<VERSION>} with the following files respectively subdirectories
\begin{enumerate}
%\item {\tt bin/win32/ore.exe}
%\item {\tt bin/x64/ore.exe}
\item {\tt App/}
\item {\tt Docs/}
\item {\tt Examples/}
\item {\tt FrontEnd/}
\item {\tt OREAnalytics/}
\item {\tt OREData/}
\item {\tt ORETest/}
\item {\tt QuantExt/}
\item {\tt QuantLib/}
\item {\tt ThirdPartyLibs/}
\item {\tt tools/}
\item {\tt xsd/}
\item {\tt userguide.pdf}
\end{enumerate} 

The first three items and {\tt userguide.pdf} are sufficient to run the compiled ORE application
on the list of examples described in the user guide (this works on Windows only). The Windows executables are located in {\tt App/bin/Win32/Release/} respectively {\tt App/bin/x64/Release/}. To continue with the compiled
executables:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure that the scripting language Python is installed on your computer, see also section \ref{sec:python}
  below;
\item Move on to the examples in section \ref{sec:examples}.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
The release bundle contains the ORE source code, which is sufficient to build ORE from sources as follows (if you build ORE for development purposes, we recommend using git though, see section \ref{sec:build_ore}):
\begin{itemize}
\item Set up Boost as described in section \ref{sec:boost}, unless already installed
\item Build QuantLib, QuantExt, OREData, OREAnalytics, App (in this order) as described in section \ref{sec:build}
\item Note that ThirdPartyLibs does not need to be built, it contains RapidXml, header only code for reading and
  writing XML files
\item Move on to section \ref{sec:python} and the examples in section \ref{sec:examples}.
\end{itemize}

Open {\tt Docs/html/index.html} to see the API documentation for QuantExt, OREData and OREAnalytics, generated by
doxygen.

\subsection{Building ORE}\label{sec:build_ore}

ORE's source code is hosted at \url{https://github.com/opensourcerisk/engine}.

\subsubsection{Git}

To access the current code base on GitHub, one needs to get {\tt git} installed first.
   
\begin{enumerate}
\item Install and setup Git on your machine following instructions at \cite{git-download}

\item Fetch ORE from github by running the following: 

{\tt\% git clone https://github.com/opensourcerisk/engine.git ore}      

This will create a folder 'ore' in your current directory that contains the codebase.

\item Initially, the QuantLib subdirectory under {\tt ore} is empty as it is a submodule pointing to the official
  QuantLib repository. To pull down locally, use the following commands:

{\tt
\% cd ore \\
\% git submodule init \\
\% git submodule update
}

\end{enumerate}

Note that one can also run 

{\footnotesize \tt\% git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/opensourcerisk/engine.git ore}

in step 2, which also performs the steps in 3.

\subsubsection{Boost}\label{sec:boost}

QuantLib and ORE depend on the boost C++ libraries. Hence these need to be installed before building QuantLib and
ORE. On all platforms the minimum required boost version is 1\_63 as of ORE release 5.
%Older versions may work on some platforms and system configurations, but were not tested.

\subsubsection*{Windows}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the pre-compiled binaries for MSVC-14 (MSVC2015) from \cite{boost-binaries}
%, any recent version should work
\begin{itemize}
\item 32-bit: \cite{boost-binaries}{\bs}VERSION{\bs}boost\_VERSION-msvc-14.0-32.exe{\bs}download 
\item 64-bit: \cite{boost-binaries}{\bs}VERSION{\bs}boost\_VERSION-msvc-14.0-64.exe{\bs}download
\end{itemize}
\item Start the installation file and choose an installation folder (the ``boost root directory''). Take a note of that folder as it will be needed later on.   
\item Finish the installation by clicking Next a couple of times.
\end{enumerate}
    
Alternatively, compile all Boost libraries directly from the source code:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open a Visual Studio Tools Command Prompt
\begin{itemize}
\item 32-bit: VS2015/VS2013 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt
\item 64-bit: VS2015/VS2013 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt
\end{itemize}
\item Navigate to the boost root directory
\item Run bootstrap.bat
\item Build the libraries from the source code
\begin{itemize}
\item 32-bit: \\
  {\footnotesize\tt .{\bs}b2 --stagedir=.{\bs}lib{\bs}Win32{\bs}lib --build-type=complete toolset=msvc-14.0 \bs \\
    address-model=32 --with-test --with-system --with-filesystem  \bs \\
    --with-serialization --with-regex --with-date\_time stage}
\item 64-bit: \\
  {\footnotesize\tt .{\bs}b2 --stagedir=.{\bs}lib{\bs}x64{\bs}lib --build-type=complete toolset=msvc-14.0 \bs \\
    address-model=64 --with-test --with-system --with-filesystem \bs \\
    --with-serialization --with-regex --with-date\_time stage}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Unix}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download Boost from \cite{boost} and build following the instructions on the site
\item Define the environment variable BOOST that points to the boost directory
(so includes should be in BOOST and libs should be in BOOST/stage/lib)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{ORE Libraries and Application}\label{sec:build}

\subsubsection*{Windows}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Download and install Visual Studio Community Edition (Version 2013 or later). 
During the installation, make sure you install the Visual
C++ support under the Programming Languages features (disabled by default).

\item Configure boost paths: \\

\medskip
  Since the release of Visual Studio 2019, the user property files 'Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user' and
  'Microsoft.Cpp.x64.user' are no longer created on installation. There are now 2 ways to configure the boost paths for Visual Studio.
  
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Set environment variables:
	\begin{itemize}
  	\item  {\tt \%BOOST\%} pointing to your directory, e.g, {\tt C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0} 
  	\item {\tt \%BOOST\_LIB32\%} pointing to your Win32 lib directory, e.g, {\tt C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0{\bs}lib32\-msvc\-14.0} 
	\item  {\tt \%BOOST\_LIB64\%} pointing to your x64 lib directory, e.g, {\tt C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0{\bs}lib64\-msvc\-14.0} 
     \end{itemize}
     These are used by the ore user.props files.
\item Create you own property file and add as a property sheet following the instructions at \url{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/create-reusable-property-configurations?view=msvc-160&viewFallbackFrom=vs-2019}
\end{enumerate}

  For older versions of Visual Studio you can use the Microsoft user property files. Open any of the Visual Studio 
  solution files in item 3 below and select View $\rightarrow$ Other Windows $\rightarrow$ Property Manager. It does not 
  matter which solution you open, if it is for example the Quant\-Ext solution you should see two Projects 'QuantExt' and 
  'quantexttestsuite' in the property manager. Expand any of them (e.g. QuantExt) and then one of the Win32 or x64 
  configurations. The settings will be specific for the Win32 or x64 configuration but otherwise it does not matter which of 
  the projects or configurations you expand, they all contain the same configuration file. You should now see 
  'Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user' respectively 'Microsoft.Cpp.x64.user' depending on whether you chose a Win32 or a x64 
  configuration. Click on this file to open the property pages. Select VC++ Directories and then add your boost directory to 
  the 'Include Directories' entry. Likewise add your boost library directory (the directory that contains the *.lib files) to the 
  'Library Directories' entry. If for example your boost installation is in {\tt
    C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0} and the libraries reside in the {\tt stage{\bs}lib} subfolder, add {\tt
    C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0} to the 'Include Directories' entry and {\tt C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0{\bs}stage{\bs} lib} to the
  'Library Directories' entry. Press OK. 
  (Alternatively, create and use an environment variable {\tt \%BOOST\%} pointing to your directory {\tt C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0} instead of the directory itself.) 
  If you want to configure the boost paths for Win32 resp. x64 as well, repeat
  the previous step for 'Microsoft.Cpp. Win32.user' respectively 'Microsoft.Cpp.x64.user'. To complete the configuration
  just close the property manager window.

\item Open the {\tt oreEverything\_*.sln} and build the entire solution (again, make sure to select the correct platform in the configuration manager first).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Generate Visual Studio Projects with CMake}

ORE 1.8.9 and later will be shipped without the Visual Studio project and solution files. The Visual Studio projects can be auto-generated from the CMake project files.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Download and install Visual Studio Community Edition (Version 2013 or later). 
During the installation, make sure you install the Visual
C++ support under the Programming Languages features (disabled by default).

\item Download and install CMake for Windows (https://cmake.org/download/). Visual Studio Community Edition 2019 or later supports CMake and you can install the feature 'C++ CMake Tools for Windows' instead of installing CMake as standalone program.

\item Set environment variables: \\
	\begin{itemize}
  	\item  {\tt \%BOOST\%} pointing to your directory, e.g, {\tt C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0} 
  	\item {\tt \%BOOST\_LIB32\%} pointing to your Win32 lib directory, e.g, {\tt C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0{\bs}lib32\-msvc\-14.0} 
	\item  {\tt \%BOOST\_LIB64\%} pointing to your x64 lib directory, e.g, {\tt C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0{\bs}lib64\-msvc\-14.0} 
     \end{itemize}

\item Generate MSVC project files from CMake files:
\begin{itemize}
\item Open a Visual Studio Tools Command Prompt
\begin{itemize}
\item 32-bit: VS2022/x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022
\item 64-bit: VS2022/x64 Native Tools   Command Prompt for VS 2022
\end{itemize}
\item Navigate to the ORE root directory
\item Run CMake command:
\begin{itemize}
\item 32-bit: \\
{\tt cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DBOOST\_INCLUDEDIR=\%BOOST\% -DBOOST\_LIBRARYDIR=\%BOOST\_LIB64\% -DMSVC\_LINK\_DYNAMIC\_RUNTIME=true -B build}
\item 64-bit: \\
{\tt cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x32 -DBOOST\_INCLUDEDIR=\%BOOST\% -DBOOST\_LIBRARYDIR=\%BOOST\_LIB32\% -DMSVC\_LINK\_DYNAMIC\_RUNTIME=true -B build}
\end{itemize}
Replace the generator "Visual Studio 17 2022" with the actual installed version.
The solution and project files will be generated in the {\tt $\langle$ORE\_ROOT$\rangle${\bs}build} subdirectory.
\end{itemize}

\item Open the {\tt build{\bs}ORE.sln} and build the entire solution (again, make sure to select the correct platform in the configuration manager first).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Unix}

With the 5th release we have discontinued automake support so that ORE can only be built with CMake on Unix systems, as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Change to the ORE project directory that contains the {\tt QuantLib}, {\tt QuantExt}, etc, folders; create subdirectory {\tt build} and change to subdirectory {\tt build}
\item Configure CMake by invoking \\
\medskip
{\tt cmake -DBOOST\_ROOT=\${BOOST} -DBOOST\_LIBRARYDIR=\${BOOST}/stage/lib ..} \\
\medskip

Alternatively, set environment variables {\tt BOOST\_ROOT} and {\tt BOOST\_LIBRARYDIR} and run \\
\medskip
{\tt cmake ..} \\
\medskip
\item Build all ORE libraries, QuantLib, as well as the doxygen API documentation for QuantExt, OREData and OREAnalytics, by invoking \\
\medskip
{\tt make -j4} \\
\medskip
using four threads in this example.
\medskip
\item Run all test suites by invoking \\
\medskip
{\tt ctest -j4}
\item Run Examples (see section \ref{sec:examples})
\end{enumerate}

Note: 
\begin{itemize}
\item If the boost libraries are not installed in a standard path they might not be found during runtime because of a missing rpath
tag in their path. Run the script {\tt rename\_libs.sh} to set the rpath tag in all libraries located in {\tt
  \${BOOST}/stage/lib}.
\item Unset {\tt LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} respectively {\tt DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} before running the ORE executable or the test suites, in order not to override the rpath information embedded into the libaries built with CMake
\item On Linux systems, the 'locale' settings can negatively affect the ORE process and output. To avoid this, we
recommend setting the environment variable {\tt LC\_NUMERIC} to {\tt C}, e.g. in a bash shell, do

{\tt\footnotesize
\% export LC\_NUMERIC=C
}

before running ORE or any of the examples below. This will suppress thousand separators in numbers when converted to
strings.

\item Generate {\tt CMakeLists.txt}:

The .cpp and .hpp files included in the build process need to be explicitly specified in the various {\tt CMakeLists.txt} 
files in the project directory. The python script (in {\tt Tools/update\_cmake\_files.py}) can be used to update all CMakeLists.txt files 
automatically. 

\end{itemize}
 
\subsubsection*{Building on Windows with CMake}

One advantage of the CMake build system is that it covers both Unix and Windows builds. 
The same set of {\tt CMakeLists.txt} files as above allows building ORE on Windows. The following instructions use the {\tt Ninja} build system ({\url{ninja-build.org}) that covers the role of {\tt make} on Unix systems and calls the Visual Studio C++ compiler and linker. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item Set environment variables: \\
	\begin{itemize}
  	\item  {\tt \%BOOST\%} pointing to your directory, e.g, {\tt C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0} 
  	\item {\tt \%BOOST\_LIB32\%} pointing to your Win32 lib directory, e.g, {\tt C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0{\bs}lib32\-msvc\-14.0} 
	\item  {\tt \%BOOST\_LIB64\%} pointing to your x64 lib directory, e.g, {\tt C:{\bs}boost\_1\_72\_0{\bs}lib64\-msvc\-14.0} 
     \end{itemize}
\item Open a command prompt, change to directory C:{\textbackslash}Program Files (x86){\textbackslash}Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0{\textbackslash}VC and run\\
\medskip
{\tt vcvarsall.bat x64} \\
\medskip
to initialize the compiler-related environment.
\item Change to the ORE project directory that contains the {\tt QuantLib}, {\tt QuantExt}, etc, folders; create subdirectory {\tt build} and change to subdirectory {\tt build}
\item Configure CMake e.g. by invoking \\
\medskip
{\tt cmake -D BOOST\_INCLUDEDIR=\%BOOST\% } \textbackslash\\
{\tt \hspace{2cm} -D BOOST\_LIBRARYDIR=\%BOOST\_LIB64\% }\textbackslash\\
{\tt \hspace{2cm} -D CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release }\textbackslash\\
{\tt \hspace{2cm} -D MSVC\_LINK\_DYNAMIC\_RUNTIME=true} \textbackslash\\
{\tt \hspace{2cm} -G Ninja ..} \\
\medskip
where the -G option allows choosing the desired build system generator.
\item Build all ORE libraries including QuantLib by invoking \\
\medskip
  {\tt ninja} \\
\medskip
Ninja automatically utilizes all available threads, unless specified with the -j option.

\item Run all test suites by invoking \\
  \medskip {\tt ctest -j4}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Python and Jupyter}\label{sec:python}

Python (version 3.5 or higher) is required to use the ORE Python language bindings in section \ref{sec:oreswig}, 
or to run the examples in section \ref{sec:examples} and plot exposure
evolutions. Moreover, we use Jupyter \cite{jupyter} in section \ref{sec:visualisation} to visualise simulation
results. Both are part of the 'Anaconda Open Data Science Analytics Platform' \cite{Anaconda}. Anaconda installation
instructions for Windows, OS X and Linux are available on the Anaconda site, with graphical installers for
Windows\footnote{With Windows, after a fresh installation of Python the user may have to run the {\tt python} command
  once in a command shell so that the Python executable will be found subsequently when running the example scripts in
  section \ref{sec:examples}.}, Linux and OS X.

With Linux and OS X, the following environment variable settings are required
\begin{itemize}
\item set {\tt LANG} and {\tt LC\_ALL } to {\tt en\_US.UTF-8} or {\tt en\_GB.UTF-8}
\item set {\tt LC\_NUMERIC} to {\tt C}. 
\end{itemize}
The former is required for both running the Python scripts in the examples section, as well as successful installation
of the following packages. \\

The full functionality of the Jupyter notebook introduced in section \ref{sec:jupyter} requires furthermore installing
\begin{itemize}
\item jupyter\_dashboards: \url{https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/dashboards}
\item ipywidgets: \url{https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets}
\item pythreejs: \url{https://github.com/jovyan/pythreejs}
\item bqplot: \url{https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot}
\end{itemize}
With Python and Anaconda already installed, this can be done by running these commands
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets}
\item {\tt pip install jupyter\_dashboards}
\item {\tt jupyter dashboards quick-setup --sys-prefix}
\item {\tt conda install -c conda-forge bqplot}
\item {\tt conda install -c conda-forge pythreejs}
\end{itemize}
Note that the bqplot installation requires the environment settings mentioned above.

\subsection{Building ORE-SWIG}\label{sec:oreswig}

Since release 4, ORE comes with Python and Java language bindings following the QuantLib-SWIG example.
The ORE bindings extend the QuantLib SWIG wrappers and allow calling ORE functionality in the 
QuantExt/OREData/OREAnalytics libraries alongside with functionality in QuantLib.  

\medskip
The ORE-SWIG source code is hosted in a separate git repository at \url{https://github.com/opensourcerisk/ore-swig}.

\medskip
To build the wrappers on Windows, Linux, mac OS
\begin{enumerate}
\item build ORE and QuantLib first, as shown in the previous section. It is strongly advised to switch the codebase to a release tag here (e.g. 1.8.7.0), as the versions of the master branch are not always aligned!
\item check out the ORE-SWIG repository into a project directory {\tt oreswig}, change into that directory (the same advice as above applies here as well, switch to the same release tag as ORE)
\item pull in the QuantLib-SWIG project by running \\
{\tt git submodule init} \\
{\tt git submodule update}
%\item Edit the top-level {\tt oreswig/CMakeLists.txt} and uncomment e.g. the line {\tt add\_subdirectory(OREAnalytics-SWIG/Python)} to build the OREAnalytics Python wrappers
\item Create a subdirectrory {\tt build}, change into that directory and configure cmake and then build using Ninja as follows \\
\medskip
{\footnotesize
{\tt cmake -G Ninja $\backslash$} \\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -D ORE=<ORE Root Directory> $\backslash$} \\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -D BOOST\_ROOT=<Top level boost include directory> $\backslash$}\\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -D BOOST\_LIBRARYDIR=<Location of the compiled boost libraries> $\backslash$}\\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -D PYTHON\_LIBRARY=<Full name including path to the 'libpython*' library> $\backslash$} \\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -D PYTHON\_INCLUDE\_DIR=<Directory that contains Python.h> $\backslash$} \\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt ..} \\
{\tt ninja} \\
}
\medskip
On Linux or mac OS one can also use {\tt make} instead of {\tt ninja}. 
In that case, omit the {\tt -G Ninja} part in the configuration. 

\medskip
To build on Windows using CMake and an existing Visual Studio installation you can e.g. run
this from the top-level oreswig directory

{\footnotesize
{\tt mkdir build $\backslash$} \\
{\tt cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" $\backslash$}\\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -A x64 $\backslash$}\\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -D SWIG\_DIR=C:$\backslash$dev$\backslash$swigwin$\backslash$Lib $\backslash$}\\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -D SWIG\_EXECUTABLE=C:$\backslash$dev$\backslash$swigwin$\backslash$swig.exe $\backslash$}\\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -D ORE:PATHNAME=C:$\backslash$dev$\backslash$ORE$\backslash$master $\backslash$}\\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -D BOOST\_ROOT=C:$\backslash$dev$\backslash$boost $\backslash$}\\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -S OREAnalytics-SWIG/Python $\backslash$}\\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -B build $\backslash$}\\
{\tt cmake --build build -v}
}

\medskip
By default this builds the OREAnalytics-Python bindings which include the wrapped parts of QuantLib, QuantExt, OREData and OREAnalytics.

\item Try a Python example: Update your PYTHONPATH environment variable to include directory {\tt oreswig/build/OREAnalytics-SWIG/Python} which contains both the new python module and the associated native library loaded by the python module;
change to the {\tt oreswig/OREAnalytics/Python/Examples} directory and run e.g.\\

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python ore.py}  

There is also an IPython example in the same directory. To try it, launch 

\medskip
\centerline{\tt jupyter notebook}  

wait for your browser to open, select {\tt ore.ipy} from the list of files and then run all cells.

\item Try a Java example: Make sure that the line {\tt add\_subdirectory(OREAnalytics-SWIG/Java)} 
is uncommented in the top-level CMakeLists.txt file when building; change to directory 
{\tt ORE-SWIG/OREAnalytics-SWIG/Java/Examples} and run

\medskip
{\tt java -Djava.library.path=../../../build/OREAnalytics-SWIG/Java $\backslash$} \\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt -jar ../../../build/OREAnalytics-SWIG/Java/ORERunner.jar $\backslash$}\\
\hspace{1cm} {\tt Input/ore.xml}

\end{enumerate}

\end{table}

All example results can be produced with the Python scripts {\tt run.py} in the ORE release's {\tt Examples/Example\_\#}
folders which work on both Windows and Unix platforms. In a nutshell, all scripts call ORE's command line application
with a single input XML file

\medskip
\centerline{\tt ore[.exe] ore.xml}
\medskip

They produce a number of standard reports and exposure graphs in PDF format. The structure of the input file and of the
portfolio, market and other configuration files referred to therein will be explained in section
\ref{sec:configuration}.

\medskip ORE is driven by a number of input files, listed in table \ref{tab_1} and explained in detail in sections
\ref{sec:configuration} to \ref{sec:fixings}. In all examples, these input files are either located in the example's sub
directory {\tt Examples/Example\_\#/Input} or the main input directory {\tt Examples/Input} if used across several
examples. The particular selection of input files is determined by the 'master' input file {\tt ore.xml}.

\begin{table}[h]
\scriptsize
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{11cm}|}
  \hline
  File Name & Description \\
  \hline
  {\tt ore.xml}&   Master input file, selection of further inputs below and selection of analytics \\
  {\tt portfolio.xml} & Trade data \\

                           of today (yield curves, FX rates, volatility surfaces etc) \\
  {\tt pricingengines.xml} &  Configuration of pricing methods by product\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{ORE input files}
\label{tab_1}
\end{table}

The typical list of output files and reports is shown in table \ref{tab_2}. The names of output files can be configured
through the master input file {\tt ore.xml}. Whether these reports are generated also depends on the setting in {\tt
  ore.xml}. For the examples, all output will be written to the directory {\tt Examples/Example\_\#/Output}.

\begin{table}[h]

Note: When building ORE from sources on Windows platforms, make sure that you copy your {\tt ore.exe} to the binary
directory {\tt App/bin/win32/} respectively {\tt App/bin/x64/}. Otherwise the examples may be run using the pre-compiled
executables which come with the ORE release.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Interest Rate Swap Exposure, Flat Market}\label{sec:example1}
%--------------------------------------------------------

We start with a vanilla single currency Swap (currency EUR, maturity 20y, notional 10m, receive fixed 2\% annual, pay
6M-Euribor flat). The market yield curves (for both discounting and forward projection) are set to be flat at 2\% for
all maturities, i.e. the Swap is at the money initially and remains at the money on average throughout its life. Running
ORE in directory {\tt Examples/Example\_1} with

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python run.py } 
\medskip

yields the exposure evolution in 

\medskip
\centerline{\tt Examples/Example\_1/Output/*.pdf } 
\medskip

and shown in figure \ref{fig_1}. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_swap_1_1m_sbb_100k.pdf}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_swap_1_1m_sbb_10k_flat.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Vanilla ATM Swap expected exposure in a flat market environment from both parties' perspectives. The symbols are European Swaption prices. The simulation was run with monthly time steps and 10,000 Monte Carlo samples to demonstrate the convergence of EPE and ENE profiles. A similar
outcome can be obtained more quickly with 5,000 samples on a quarterly time grid which is the default setting of Example\_1. }
\label{fig_1}
\end{figure}
Both Swap simulation and Swaption pricing are run with calls to the ORE executable, essentially 

\medskip
\centerline{\tt ore[.exe] ore.xml} 

\centerline{\tt ore[.exe] ore\_swaption.xml} 
\medskip

which are wrapped into the script {\tt Examples/Example\_1/run.py} provided with the ORE release.
It is instructive to look into the input folder in Examples/Example\_1, the content of the main input file {\tt
  ore.xml}, together with the explanations in section \ref{sec:configuration}. \\

This simple example is an important test case which is also run similarly in one of the unit test suites of ORE. The
expected exposure can be seen as a European option on the underlying netting set, see also appendix
\ref{sec:app_exposure}. In this example, the expected exposure at some future point in time, say 10 years, is equal to
the European Swaption price for an option with expiry in 10 years, underlying Swap start in 10 years and underlying Swap
maturity in 20 years. We can easily compute such standard European Swaption prices for all future points in time where
both Swap legs reset, i.e. annually in this case\footnote{Using closed form expressions for standard European Swaption
  prices.}. And if the simulation model has been calibrated to the points on the Swaption surface which are used for
European Swaption pricing, then we can expect to see that the simulated exposure matches Swaption prices at these annual
points, as in figure \ref{fig_1}.  In Example\_1 we used co-terminal ATM Swaptions for both model calibration and
Swaption pricing. Moreover, as the yield curve is flat in this example, the exposures from both parties'
perspectives (EPE and ENE) match not only at the annual resets, but also for the period between annual reset of both
legs to the point in time when the floating leg resets. Thereafter, between floating leg (only) reset and next joint
fixed/floating leg reset, we see and expect a deviation of the two exposure profiles.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Interest Rate Swap Exposure, Realistic Market}\label{sec:example2}
%--------------------------------------------------------

Moving to {\tt Examples/Example\_2}, we see what changes when using a realistic (non-flat) market
environment. Running the example with

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python run.py } 
\medskip

yields the exposure evolution in 

\medskip
\centerline{\tt Examples/Example\_2/Output/*.pdf } 
\medskip

shown in figure \ref{fig_2}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_swap_3.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Vanilla ATM Swap expected exposure in a realistic market environment as of 05/02/2016 from both parties'
  perspectives. The Swap is the same as in figure \ref{fig_1} but receiving fixed 1\%, roughly at the money. The symbols
  are the prices of European payer and receiver Swaptions. Simulation with 5000 paths and monthly time steps.}
\label{fig_2}
\end{figure}
In this case, where the curves (discount and forward) are upward sloping, the receiver Swap is at the money at inception
only and moves (on average) out of the money during its life. Similarly, the Swap moves into the money from the
counterparty's perspective. Hence the expected exposure evolutions from our perspective (EPE) and the counterparty's
perspective (ENE) 'detach' here, while both can still be be reconciled with payer or respectively receiver Swaption
prices.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{European Swaption Exposure}\label{sec:european_swaption}
%--------------------------------------------------------

This demo case in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_3} shows the exposure evolution of European Swaptions with cash and
physical delivery, respectively, see figure \ref{fig_3}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_swaption.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{European Swaption exposure evolution, expiry in 10 years, final maturity in 20 years, for cash and physical
  delivery. Simulation with 1000 paths and quarterly time steps. }
\label{fig_3}
\end{figure}
The delivery type (cash vs physical) yields significantly different valuations as of today due to the steepness of the
relevant yield curves (EUR). The cash settled Swaption's exposure graph is truncated at the exercise date, whereas the
physically settled Swaption exposure turns into a Swap-like exposure after expiry. For comparison, the example also
provides the exposure evolution of the underlying forward starting Swap which yields a somewhat higher exposure after
the forward start date than the physically settled Swaption. This is due to scenarios with negative Swap NPV at expiry
(hence not exercised) and positive NPVs thereafter. Note the reduced EPE in case of a Swaption with settlement of the option premium on exercise date.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Bermudan Swaption Exposure}
%--------------------------------------------------------

This demo case in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_4} shows the exposure evolution of Bermudan rather than European
Swaptions with cash and physical delivery, respectively, see figure \ref{fig_3b}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_bermudan_swaption.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Bermudan Swaption exposure evolution, 5 annual exercise dates starting in 10 years, final maturity in 20 years,
  for cash and physical delivery. Simulation with 1000 paths and quarterly time steps.}
\label{fig_3b}
\end{figure}
The underlying Swap is the same as in the European Swaption example in section \ref{sec:european_swaption}. Note in
particular the difference between the Bermudan and European Swaption exposures with cash settlement: The Bermudan shows
the typical step-wise decrease due to the series of exercise dates. Also note that we are using the same Bermudan option
pricing engines for both settlement types, in contrast to the European case, so that the Bermudan option cash and
physical exposures are identical up to the first exercise date. When running this example, you will notice the
significant difference in computation time compared to the European case (ballpark 30 minutes here for 2 Swaptions, 1000
samples, 90 time steps). The Bermudan example takes significantly more computation time because we use an LGM grid
engine for pricing under scenarios in this case. In a realistic context one would more likely resort to American Monte
Carlo simulation, feasible in ORE, but not provided in the current release. However, this implementation can be used to
benchmark any faster / more sophisticated approach to Bermudan Swaption exposure simulation.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Callable Swap Exposure}
%--------------------------------------------------------

This demo case in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_5} shows the exposure evolution of a European callable Swap, represented
as two trades - the non-callable Swap and a Swaption with physical delivery. We have sold the call option, i.e. the
Swaption is a right for the counterparty to enter into an offsetting Swap which economically terminates all future flows
if exercised. The resulting exposure evolutions for the individual components (Swap, Swaption), as well as the callable
Swap are shown in figure \ref{fig_4}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_callable_swap.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{European callable Swap represented as a package consisiting of non-callable Swap and Swaption. The Swaption has
  physical delivery and offsets all future Swap cash flows if exercised. The exposure evolution of the package is shown
  here as 'EPE Netting Set' (green line). This is covered by the pink line, the exposure evolution of the same Swap but
  with maturity on the exercise date. The graphs match perfectly here, because the example Swap is deep in the money and
  exercise probability is close to one. Simulation with 5000 paths and quarterly time steps.}
\label{fig_4}
\end{figure}
The example is an extreme case where the underlying Swap is deeply in the money (receiving fixed 5\%), and hence the
call exercise probability is close to one. Modify the Swap and Swaption fixed rates closer to the money ($\approx$ 1\%)
to see the deviation between net exposure of the callable Swap and the exposure of a 'short' Swap with maturity on
exercise.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Cap/Floor Exposure}\label{sec:capfloor}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_6} generates exposure evolutions of several Swaps, caps and floors. The
example shown in figure \ref{fig_capfloor_1} ('portfolio 1') consists of a 20y Swap receiving 3\% fixed and paying
Euribor 6M plus a long 20y Collar
with both cap and floor at 4\% so that the net exposure corresponds to a Swap paying 1\% fixed. \\

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_capfloor_1.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Swap+Collar, portfolio 1. The Collar has identical cap and floor rates at 4\% so that it corresponds to a
  fixed leg which reduces the exposure of the Swap, which receives 3\% fixed. Simulation with 1000 paths and quarterly
  time steps.}
\label{fig_capfloor_1}
\end{figure}

The second example in this folder shown in figure \ref{fig_capfloor_2} ('portfolio 2') consists of a short Cap, long
Floor and a long Collar that exactly offsets the netted Cap and Floor.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}

\end{figure}

Further three test portfolios are provided as part of this example. Run the example and inspect the respective output
directories {\tt Examples/Example\_6/Output/portfolio\_\#}. Note that these directories have to be present/created
before running the batch with {\tt python run.py}.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{FX Forward and FX Option Exposure}\label{sec:fxfwd}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_7} generates the exposure evolution for a EUR / USD FX Forward transaction
with value date in 10Y. This is a particularly simple show case because of the single cash flow in 10Y. On the other
hand it checks the cross currency model implementation by means of comparison to analytic limits - EPE and ENE at the
trade's value date must match corresponding Vanilla FX Option prices, as shown in figure \ref{fig_5}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_fxforward.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{EUR/USD FX Forward expected exposure in a realistic market environment as of 26/02/2016 from both parties'
  perspectives. Value date is obviously in 10Y. The flat lines are FX Option prices which coincide with EPE and ENE,
  respectively, on the value date. Simulation with 5000 paths and quarterly time steps.}
\label{fig_5}
\end{figure}

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{FX Option Exposure}\label{sec:fxoption}
%--------------------------------------------------------

This example (in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_7}, as the FX Forward example) illustrates the exposure evolution for an
FX Option, see figure \ref{fig_7}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_fxoption.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{EUR/USD FX Call and Put Option exposure evolution, same underlying and market data as in section
  \ref{sec:fxfwd}, compared to the call and put option price as of today (flat line). Simulation with 5000 paths and
  quarterly time steps.}
\label{fig_7}
\end{figure}
Recall that the FX Option value $NPV(t)$ as of time $0 \leq t \leq T$ satisfies
\begin{align*}
\frac{NPV(t)}{N(t)} &= \mbox{Nominal}\times\E_t\left[\frac{(X(T) - K)^+}{N(T)}\right]\\
NPV(0) &= \E\left[\frac{NPV(t)}{N(t)}\right] = \E\left[\frac{NPV^+(t)}{N(t)} \right]= \EPE(t) 
\end{align*}
where $N(t)$ denotes the numeraire asset.
One would therefore expect a flat exposure evolution up to option expiry. The deviation from this in ORE's simulation is
due to the pricing approach chosen here under scenarios. A Black FX option pricer is used with deterministic Black
volatility derived from today's volatility structure (pushed or rolled forward, see section \ref{sec:sim_market}). The
deviation can be removed by extending the volatility modelling, e.g. implying model consistent Black volatilities in
each simulation step on each path.

\subsection{Cross Currency Swap Exposure, without FX Reset}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The case in {\tt Examples/Example\_8} is a vanilla cross currency Swap. It shows the typical blend of an Interest Rate
Swap's saw tooth exposure evolution with an FX Forward's exposure which increases monotonically to final maturity, see
figure \ref{fig_6}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_ccswap.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Cross Currency Swap exposure evolution without mark-to-market notional reset. Simulation with 1000 paths and
  quarterly time steps.}
\label{fig_6}
\end{figure}

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Cross Currency Swap Exposure, with FX Reset}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The effect of the FX resetting feature, common in Cross Currency Swaps nowadays, is shown in {\tt Examples/Example\_9}.
The example shows the exposure evolution of a EUR/USD cross currency basis Swap with FX reset at each interest period
start, see figure \ref{fig_6b}. As expected, the notional reset causes an exposure collapse at each period start when
the EUR leg's notional is reset to match the USD notional.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_xccy_reset.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Cross Currency Basis Swap exposure evolution with and without mark-to-market notional reset. Simulation with

\label{fig_6b}
\end{figure}
  
%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Netting Set, Collateral, XVAs, XVA Allocation}
%--------------------------------------------------------

In this example (see folder {\tt Examples/Example\_10}) we showcase a small netting set consisting of three Swaps in
different currencies, with different collateral choices
\begin{itemize}
\item no collateral - figure \ref{fig_8},
\item collateral with threshold (THR) 1m EUR, minimum transfer amount (MTA) 100k EUR, margin period of risk (MPOR) 2
  weeks - figure \ref{fig_9}
\item collateral with zero THR and MTA, and MPOR 2w - figure \ref{fig_10}
\end{itemize}
The exposure graphs with collateral and positive margin period of risk show typical spikes. What is causing these? As
sketched in appendix \ref{sec:app_collateral}, ORE uses a {\em classical collateral model} that applies collateral
amounts to offset exposure with a time delay that corresponds to the margin period of risk. The spikes are then caused
by instrument cash flows falling between exposure measurement dates $d_1$ and $d_2$ (an MPOR apart), so that a
collateral delivery amount determined at $d_1$ but settled at $d_2$ differs significantly from the closeout amount at
$d_2$ causing a significant residual exposure for a short period of time. See for example \cite{Andersen2016} for a
recent detailed discussion of collateral modelling. The approach currently implemented in ORE corresponds to {\em
  Classical+} in \cite{Andersen2016}, the more conservative approach of the classical methods. The less conservative
alternative, {\em Classical-}, would assume that both parties stop paying trade flows at the beginning of the MPOR, so
that the P\&L over the MPOR does not contain the cash flow effect, and exposure spikes are avoided. Note that the size
and position of the largest spike in figure \ref{fig_9} is consistent with a cash flow of the 40 million GBP Swap in the
example's portfolio that rolls over the 3rd of March and has a cash flow on 3 March 2020, a bit more than four years
from the evaluation date.

\subsection*{CVA, DVA, FVA, COLVA, MVA, Collateral Floor}
%--------------------------------------------------------

We use one of the cases in {\tt Examples/Example\_10} to demonstrate the
XVA outputs, see folder {\tt Examples/Example\_10/Output/collateral\_threshold\_dim}.

\medskip The summary of all value adjustments (CVA, DVA, FVA, COLVA, MVA, as well as the Collateral Floor) is provided
in file {\tt xva.csv}.  The file includes the allocated CVA and DVA numbers to individual trades as introduced in the
next section. The following table illustrates the file's layout, omitting the three columns containing allocated data.

The exposure measures EPE, ENE and PFE, and the Basel exposure measures $EE_B$ and $EEE_B$, are defined in appendix
\ref{sec:app_exposure}. Allocated exposures are defined in appendix \ref{sec:app_allocation}. The PFE quantile and
allocation method are chosen as described in section \ref{sec:analytics}. \\

Allocated exposures are missing here, as they make sense at the trade level only, and the expected collateral balance is
added for information (in this case zero as collateralisation is deactivated in this example).

\medskip The allocation of netting set exposure and XVA to the trade level is frequently required by finance
departments. This allocation is also featured in {\tt Examples/Example\_10}. We start again with the uncollateralised
case in figure \ref{fig_12}, followed by the case with threshold 1m EUR in figure \ref{fig_13}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_nocollateral_allocated_epe.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Exposure allocation without collateral. Simulation with 5000 paths and bi-weekly time steps.}
\label{fig_12}
\end{figure}
In both cases we apply the {\em marginal} (Euler) allocation method as published by Pykhtin and Rosen in 2010, hence we
see the typical negative EPE for one of the trades at times when it reduces the netting set exposure. The case with
collateral moreover shows the typical spikes in the allocated exposures.
\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{center}
\caption{Exposure allocation with collateral and threshold 1m EUR. Simulation with 5000 paths and bi-weekly time steps.}
\label{fig_13}
\end{figure}
The analytics results also feature allocated XVAs in file {\tt xva.csv} which are derived from the allocated exposure
profiles. Note that ORE also offers alternative allocation methods to the marginal method by Pykhtin/Rosen, which can be
explored with {\tt Examples/Example\_10}.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Basel Exposure Measures}\label{sec:basel}
%--------------------------------------------------------

Example {\tt Example\_11} demonstrates the relation between the evolution of the expected exposure (EPE in our notation)
to the `Basel' exposure measures EE\_B, EEE\_B, EPE\_B and EEPE\_B as defined in appendix \ref{sec:app_exposure}. In
particular the latter is used in internal model methods for counterparty credit risk as a measure for the exposure at
default. It is a `derivative' of the expected exposure evolution and defined as a time average over the running maximum
of EE\_B up to the horizon of one year.
\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_basel_exposures.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Evolution of the expected exposure of Vanilla Swap, comparison to the `Basel' exposure measures EEE\_B, EPE\_B and EEPE\_B. Note that the latter two are indistinguishable in this case, because the expected exposure is increasing for the first year.}
\label{fig_14}
\end{figure}

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Long Term Simulation with Horizon Shift}\label{sec:longterm}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Example\_12} finally demonstrates an effect that, at first glance, seems to cause a serious
issue with long term simulations. Fortunately this can be avoided quite easily in the Linear Gauss Markov model setting
that is used here. \\

In the example we consider a Swap with maturity in 50 years in a flat yield curve environment. If we simulate this
naively as in all previous cases, we obtain a particularly noisy EPE profile that does not nearly reconcile with the
known exposure (analytical Swaption prices). This is shown in figure \ref{fig_15} (`no horizon shift'). The origin of
this issue is the width of the risk-neutral NPV distribution at long time horizons which can turn out to be quite small
so that the Monte Carlo simulation with finite number of samples does not reach far enough into the positive or negative
NPV range to adequately sample the distribution, and estimate both EPE and ENE in a single run.  Increasing the number
of samples may not solve the problem, and may not even be feasible in a realistic setting. \\

The way out is applying a `shift transformation' to the Linear Gauss Markov model, see {\tt
  Example\_12/Input/simulation2.xml} in lines 92-95:
\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
        <ParameterTransformation>
          <ShiftHorizon>30.0</ShiftHorizon>
          <Scaling>1.0</Scaling>
        </ParameterTransformation>
\end{minted}
%\hrule
%\caption{LGM Shift transformation}
%\label{lst:shift_transformation}
\end{listing}

The effect of the 'ShiftHorizon' parameter $T$ is to apply a shift to the Linear Gauss Markov model's $H(t)$ parameter
(see appendix \ref{sec:app_rfe}) {\em after} the model has been calibrated, i.e. to replace:
$$ 
H(t) \rightarrow H(t) - H(T) 
$$ 
It can be shown that this leaves all expectations computed in the model (such as EPE and ENE) invariant. As explained in
\cite{Lichters}, subtracting an $H$ shift effectively means performing a change of measure from the `native' LGM measure
to a T-Forward measure with horizon $T$, here 30 years. Both negative and positive shifts are permissible, but only
negative shifts are connected with a T-Forward measure and improve numerical stability. \\

In our experience it is helpful to place the horizon in the middle of the portfolio duration to significantly improve
the quality of long term expectations. The effect of this change (only) is shown in the same figure \ref{fig_15}
(`shifted horizon').

\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_longterm.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Long term Swap exposure simulation with and without horizon shift.}
\label{fig_15}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig_15b} further illustrates the origin of the problem and its resolution: The rate distribution's mean
(without horizon shift or change of measure) drifts upwards due to convexity effects (note that the yield curve is flat
in this example), and the distribution's width is then too narrow at long horizons to yield a sufficient number of low
rate scenarios with contributions to the Swap's $\EPE$ (it is a floating rate payer). With the horizon shift (change of
measure), the distribution's mean is pulled 'back' at long horizons, because the convexity effect is effectively wiped
out at the chosen horizon, and the expected rate matches the forward rate.

\subsection{Dynamic Initial Margin and MVA}\label{sec:dim}
%--------------------------------------------------------

This example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_13} demonstrates Dynamic Initial Margin calculations (see also appendix
\ref{sec:app_dim}) for a number of elementary products:
\begin{itemize}
\item A single currency Swap in EUR (case A), 
\item a European Swaption in EUR with physical delivery (case B), 
\item a single currency Swap in USD (case C), and 
\item a EUR/USD cross currency Swap (case D).
\end{itemize}

The examples can be run as before with 

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python run\_A.py} 

\medskip
and likewise for cases B, C and D. The essential results of each run are are visualised in the form of 
\begin{itemize}
\item evolution of expected DIM
\item regression plots at selected future times 
\end{itemize}
illustrated for cases A and B in figures \ref{fig_ex13a_evolution} - \ref{fig_ex13b_regression}. 
In the three swap cases, the regression orders do make a noticeable difference in the respective expected DIM evolution. In the Swaption case B, first and second order polynomial choice makes a difference before option expiry. More details on this DIM model and its performance can be found in \cite{Anfuso2016,LichtersEtAl}.

\subsection{Minimal Market Data Setup}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_14} demonstrates using a minimal market data setup in order to rerun the vanilla Swap exposure simulation shown in {\tt Examples/Example\_1}. The minimal market data uses single points per curve where possible.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis, Stress Testing and Parametric Value-at-Risk}\label{ex:sensitivity_stress}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_15} demonstrates the calculation of sensitivities and stress scenarios. The
portfolio used in this example consists of

\begin{itemize}
\item a vanilla swap in EUR
\item a cross currency swap EUR-USD
\item a resettable cross currency swap EUR-USD
\item a FX forward EUR-USD
\item a FX call option on USD/GBP % commented out?
\item a FX put option on USD/EUR
\item an European swaption
\item a Bermudan swaption 
\item a cap and a floor in USD
\item a cap and a floor in EUR
\item a fixed rate bond
\item a floating rate bond with floor
\item an Equity call option, put option and forward on S\&P500
\item an Equity call option, put option and forward on Lufthansa
\item a CPI Swap referencing UKRPI
\item a Year-on-Year inflation swap referencing EUHICPXT
\item a USD CDS.
\end{itemize}

The sensitivity configuration in {\tt sensitivity.xml} aims at computing the following sensitivities

\begin{itemize}
\item discount curve sensitivities in EUR, USD; GBP, CHF, JPY, on pillars 6M, 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y, 15Y, 20Y (absolute shift of 0.0001)
\item forward curve sensitivities for EUR-EURIBOR 6M and 3M indices, EUR-EONIA, USD-LIBOR 3M and 6M, GBP-LIBOR 3M and
  6M, CHF-LIBOR-6M and JPY-LIBOR-6M indices (absolute shift of 0.0001)
\item yield curve shifts for a bond benchmark curve in EUR (absolute shift of 0.0001)
\item FX spot sensitivities for USD, GBP, CHF, JPY against EUR as the base currency (relative shift of 0.01)
\item FX vegas for USDEUR, GBPEUR, JPYEUR volatility surfaces (relative shift of 0.01)
\item swaption vegas for the EUR surface on expiries 1Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y and underlying terms 1Y, 5Y, 10Y (relative shift of 0.01)
\item caplet vegas for EUR and USD on an expiry grid 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y and strikes 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04,
  0.05. (absolute shift of 0.0001)
\item credit curve sensitivities on tenors 6M, 1Y, 2Y, 5Y, 10Y (absolute shift of 0.0001).
\item Equity spots for S\&P500 and Lufthansa
\item Equity vegas for S\&P500 and Lufthansa at expiries 6M, 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 5Y
\item Zero inflation curve deltas for UKRPI and EUHICPXT at tenors 6M, 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y, 15Y, 20Y
\item Year on year inflation curve deltas for EUHICPXT at tenors 6M, 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y, 15Y, 20Y
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, mixed second order derivatives (``cross gammas'') are computed for discount-discount, discount-forward and
forward-forward curves in EUR.

By definition the sensitivities are zero rate sensitivities and optionlet sensitivities, no par sensitivities are
provided. The sensitivity analysis produces three output files.

The first, {\tt scenario.csv}, contains the shift
direction ({\tt UP}, {\tt DOWN}, {\tt CROSS}), the base NPV, the scenario NPV and the difference of these two for each
trade and sensitivity key. For an overview over the possible scenario keys see \ref{sec:sensitivity}.

The second file, {\tt sensitivity.csv}, contains the shift size (in absolute terms always) and first (``Delta'') and second
(``Gamma'') order finite differences computed from the scenario results. Note that the Delta and Gamma results are pure
differences, i.e. they are not divided by the shift size.

The second file also contains second order mixed differences according to the specified cross gamma filter, along with the shift sizes for the two factors involved.

The stress scenario definition in {\tt stresstest.xml} defines two stress tests:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt parallel\_rates}: Rates are shifted in parallel by 0.01 (absolute). The EUR bond benchmark curve is shifted by
  increasing amounts 0.001, ..., 0.009 on the pillars 6M, ..., 20Y. FX Spots are shifted by 0.01 (relative), FX vols by
  0.1 (relative), swaption and cap floor vols by 0.0010 (absolute).
  Credit curves are not yet shifted.
\item {\tt twist}: The EUR bond benchmark curve is shifted by amounts -0.0050, -0.0040, -0.0030, -0.0020, 0.0020,
  0.0040, 0.0060, 0.0080, 0.0100 on pillars 6M, 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y, 15Y, 20Y.
\end{itemize}

The corresponding output file {\tt stresstest.csv} contains the base NPV, the NPV under the scenario shifts and the
difference of the two for each trade and scenario label.

%\todo[inline]{Update after CDS has been added to the example.}
\medskip
Finally, this example demonstrates a parametric VaR calculation based on the sensitivity and cross gamma output from the sensitivity analysis (deltas, vegas, gammas, cross gammas) and an external covariance matrix input. The result in {\tt var.csv} shows a breakdown by portfolio, risk class (All, Interest Rate, FX, Inflation, Equity, Credit) and risk type (All, Delta \& Gamma, Vega). The results shown are Delta Gamma Normal VaRs for the 95\% and 99\% quantile, the holding period is incorporated into the input covariances. Alternatively, one can choose a Monte Carlo VaR which means that the sensitivity based P\&L distribution is evaluated with MC simulation assuming normal respectively log-normal risk factor distribution. 
 
%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Equity Derivatives Exposure}\label{ex:equityderivatives}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_16} demonstrates the computation of NPV, sensitivities, exposures and XVA for a portfolio 
of OTC equity derivatives. The portfolio used in this example consists of:

\begin{itemize}
	\item an equity call option denominated in EUR (``Luft'')
	\item an equity put option denominated in EUR (``Luft'')
	\item an equity forward denominated in EUR (``Luft'')
	\item an equity call option denominated in USD (``SP5'')
	\item an equity put option denominated in USD (``SP5'')
	\item an equity forward denominated in USD (``SP5'')
	\item an equity Swap in USD with return type  ``price'' (``SP5'')
	\item an equity Swap in USD with return type ``total'' (``SP5'')
\end{itemize}

The step-by-step procedure for running ORE is identical for equities as for other asset classes; the same market and 
portfolio data files are used to store the equity market data and trade details, respectively. For the exposure 
simulation, the calibration parameters for the equity risk factors can be set in the usual {\tt simulation.xml} file.

Looking at the MtM results in the output file {\tt npv.csv} we observe that put-call parity ($V_{Fwd} = V_{Call} - 
V_{Put}$) is observed as expected. Looking at Figure \ref{fig_eq_call} we observe that the Expected Exposure profile of 
the equity call option trade is relatively smooth over time, while for the equity forward trade the Expected Exposure 
tends to increase as we approach maturity. This behaviour is similar to what we observe in sections \ref{sec:fxfwd} 
and \ref{sec:fxoption}.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Inflation Swap Exposure under Dodgson-Kainth}% Example 17
\label{example:17}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example portfolio in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_17} contains two CPI Swaps and one Year-on-Year Inflation Swap.
The terms of the three trades are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item CPI Swap 1: Exchanges on 2036-02-05 a fixed amount of 20m GBP for a 10m GBP notional inflated with UKRPI with base CPI 210
\item CPI Swap 2: Notional 10m GBP, maturity 2021-07-18, exchanging GBP Libor for GBP Libor 6M vs. $2\%$ x CPI-Factor (Act/Act), inflated with index UKRPI with base CPI 210
\item YOY Swap: Notional 10m EUR, maturity 2021-02-05, exchanging fixed coupons for EUHICPXT year-on-year inflation coupons
\item YOY Swap with capped/floored YOY leg: Notional 10m EUR, maturity 2021-02-05, exchanging fixed coupons for EUHICPXT year-on-year inflation coupons, YOY leg capped with 0.03 and floored with 0.005
\item YOY Swap with scheduled capped/floored YOY leg: Notional 10m EUR, maturity 2021-02-05, exchanging fixed coupons for EUHICPXT year-on-year inflation coupons, YOY leg capped with cap schedule and floored with floor schedule
\end{itemize}

The example generates cash flows, NPVs, exposure evolutions, XVAs, as well as two exposure graphs for CPI Swap 1 respectively the YOY Swap. For the YOY Swap and the both YOY Swaps with capped/floored YOY leg, the example generates their cash flows, NPVs, exposure evolutions, XVAs and sensitivities. Figure \ref{fig_cpi_swap} shows the CPI Swap exposure evolution.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_cpi_swap.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{CPI Swap 1 exposure evolution. Simulation with 1000 paths and quarterly time steps.}
	\label{fig_cpi_swap}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig_yoy_swap} shows the evolution of the 5Y maturity Year-on-Year inflation swap for comparison. Note that the inflation simulation model (Dodgson-Kainth, see appendix \ref{sec:app_rfe}) yields the evolution of inflation indices and inflation zero bonds which allows spanning future inflation zero curves and the pricing of CPI swaps. To price Year-on-Year inflation Swaps under future scenarios, we imply Year-on-Year inflation curves from zero inflation curves\footnote{Currently we discard the required (small) convexity adjustment. This will be supplemented in a subsequent release.}. Note that for pricing Year-on-Year Swaps as of today we use a separate inflation curve bootstrapped from quoted Year-on-Year inflation Swaps.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Bonds and Amortisation Structures}% Example 18
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_18} computes NPVs and cash flow projections for a vanilla bond portfolio
consisting of a range of bond products, in particular demonstrating amortisation features:
\begin{itemize}
\item fixed rate bond
\item floating rate bond linked to Euribor 6M
\item bond switching from fixed to floating
\item bond with 'fixed amount' amortisation
\item bond with percentage amortisation relative to the initial notional
\item bond with percentage amortisation relative to the previous notional
\item bond with fixed annuity amortisation
\item bond with floating annuity amortisation (this example needs QuantLib 1.10 or higher to work, in particular the amount() method in the Coupon class needs to be virtual)
\item bond with fixed amount amortisation followed by percentage amortisation relative to previous notional
\end{itemize}

After running the example, the results of the computation can be found in the output files {\tt npv.csv} and {\tt
  flows.csv}, respectively.

\medskip
Note that the amortisation features used here are linked to the LegData structure, hence not limited to the Bond instrument, see section \ref{ss:amortisationdata}.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Swaption Pricing with Smile}% Example 19
%--------------------------------------------------------

This example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_19} demonstrates European Swaption pricing with and without smile. Calling

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python run.py}

\medskip
will launch two ORE runs using config files {\tt ore\_flat.xml} and {\tt ore\_smile.xml}, respectively. The only difference in these is referencing alternative market configurations {\tt todaymarket\_flat.xml} and {\tt todaysmarket\_smile.xml} using an ATM Swaption volatility matrix and a Swaption cube, respectively. NPV results are written to {\tt npv\_flat.cvs} and {\tt npv\_smile.csv}.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Credit Default Swap Pricing}% Example 20
%--------------------------------------------------------

This example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_20} demonstrates Credit Default Swap pricing via ORE. Calling

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python run.py}

\medskip
will launch a single ORE run to process a single name CDS example and to generate NPV and cash flows in the usual result files. 

\medskip
CDS can be included in sensitivity analysis and stress testing. Exposure simulation for credit derivatives will follow in the next ORE release.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{CMS and CMS Cap/Floor Pricing}% Example 21
%--------------------------------------------------------

This example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_21} demonstrates the pricing of CMS and CMS Cap/Floor using a portfolio consisting of a CMS Swap (CMS leg vs. fixed leg) and a CMS Cap. Calling

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python run.py}

\medskip
will launch a single ORE run to process the portfolio and generate NPV and cash flows in the usual result files. 

\medskip
CMS structures can be included in sensitivity analysis, stress testing and exposure simulation. 

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Option Sensitivity Analysis with Smile}% Example 22
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_22} demonstrates the current state of sensitivity calculation for European options where the volatility surface has a smile. 

\medskip
The portfolio used in this example consists of
\begin{itemize}
	\item an equity call option denominated in USD (``SP5'')
	\item an equity put option denominated in USD (``SP5'')
	\item a receiver swaption in EUR
	\item an FX call option on EUR/USD
\end{itemize}

\medskip
Refer to appendix \ref{sec:app_sensi} for the current status of sensitivity implementation with smile. In this example the setup is as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item today's market is configured with volatility smile for all three products above
\item simulation market has two configurations, to simulate ``ATM only'' or the ``full surface''; ``ATM only'' means that only ATM volatilities are to be simulated and shifts to ATM vols are propagated to the respective smile section (see appendix \ref{sec:app_sensi});  
\item the sensitivity analysis has two corresponding configurations as well, ``ATM only'' and ``full surface''; note that the ``full surface'' configuration leads to explicit sensitivities by strike only in the case of Swaption volatilities, for FX and Equity volatilities only ATM sensitivity can be specified at the moment and sensitivity output is currently aggregated to the ATM bucket (to be extended in subsequent releases).
\end{itemize}

The respective output files end with ``{\tt\_fullSurface.csv}'' respectively ``{\tt\_atmOnly.csv}''.

%ORE supports two methods of simulating equity volatility smile. The first method simulates the entire surface using specific moneyness levels configured in simulation.xml. The second method simulates only the ATM equity volatilities, the other strikes are shifted relative to this new ATM using the $t_{0}$ smile.  This example compares both methods using the same sensitivity configuration as in {\tt Examples/Example\_15}. For the first method {\tt simulation\_fullSurface.xml} is used and all output files are appended with ``\_fullSurface'', for the second method {\tt simulation\_atmOnly.xml} is used and all output files are appended with ``\_atmOnly''.


%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{FRA and Average OIS Exposure}% Example 23
%--------------------------------------------------------

This example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_23} demonstrates pricing, cash flow projection and exposure simulation for two additional products
\begin{itemize}
\item Forward Rate Agreements
\item Averaging Overnight Index Swaps
\end{itemize}
using a minimal portfolio of four trades, one FRA and three OIS. The essential results are in {\tt npv.csv}, {\tt flows.csv} and 
four {\tt exposure\_trade\_*.csv} files.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Commodity Derivatives, Pricing, Sensitivity, Exposure}% Example 24
\label{example:24}
%--------------------------------------------------------

Calling

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python run.py}

\medskip
in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_24} will launch two ORE runs. The first one determined by {\tt ore.xml} demonstrates pricing and sensitivity analysis for
\begin{itemize}
\item Commodity Forwards
\item European Commodity Options
\end{itemize}
using a minimal portfolio of four forwards and two options referencing WTI and Gold. 
The essential results are in {\tt npv.csv} and {\tt sensitivity.csv}.

The second run determined by {\tt ore\_wti.xml} demonstrates Commodity exposure simulation for a portfolio including a
\begin{itemize}
\item Commodity Forward
\item Commodity Swap
\item European Commodity Option
\item Commodity Average Price Option
\item Commodity Swaption
\end{itemize}
with the usual results, exposure reports and graphs. 

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{CMS Spread with (Digital) Cap/Floor}% Example 25
\label{example:25}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_25}  demonstrates pricing, sensitivity analysis 
and exposure simulation for 
\begin{itemize}
\item Capped/Floored CMS Spreads
\item CMS Spreads with Digital Caps/Floors
\end{itemize}

The example can be run with

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python run.py}

\medskip
and results are in {\tt npv.csv}, {\tt sensitivity.csv}, {\tt exposure\_*.csv} 
and the exposure graphs in {\tt mpl\_cmsspread.pdf}.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Bootstrap Consistency}% Example 26
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_26} confirms that bootstrapped curves 
correctly reprice the bootstrap instruments (FRAs, Interest Rate Swaps, FX Forwards, Cross
Currency Basis Swaps) using three pricing setups with
\begin{itemize}
\item EUR collateral discounting (configuration xois\_eur)
\item USD collateral discounting (configuration xois\_usd)
\item in-currency OIS discounting (configuration collateral\_inccy)
\end{itemize}
all defined in {\tt Examples/Input/todaysmarket.xml}.

\medskip
The required portfolio files need to be generated from market data and conventions in
{\tt Examples/Input} and trade templates in 
{\tt Examples/Example\_26/Helpers}, calling

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python TradeGenerator.py}

\medskip
This will place three portfolio files {\tt *\_portfolio.xml} in the input folder.
Thereafter, the three consistency checks can be run calling

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python run.py}

\medskip
Results are in three files {\tt *\_npv.csv} and should show zero NPVs for all benchmark instruments.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{BMA Basis Swap}% Example 27
\label{example:27}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_27} demonstrates pricing 
and sensitivity analysis for a series of USD Libor 3M vs. Averaged BMA (SIFMA) 
Swaps that correspond to the instruments used to bootstrap the BMA curve. 

The example can be run with

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python run.py}

\medskip
and results are in {\tt npv.csv} and {\tt sensitivity.csv}.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Discount Ratio Curves}% Example 28
\label{example:28}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_28} shows how to use a yield curve 
built from a DiscountRatio segment. 
In particular, it builds a GBP collateralized in EUR discount curve by referencing 
three other discount curves:
\begin{itemize}
\item a GBP collateralised in USD curve
\item a EUR collateralised in USD curve
\item a EUR OIS curve i.e. a EUR collateralised in EUR curve
\end{itemize}

The implicit assumption in building the curve this way is that EUR/GBP FX 
forwards collateralised in EUR have the same fair market rate as EUR/GBP 
FX forwards collateralised in USD. This assumption is illustrated in the 
example by the NPV of the two forward instruments in the portfolio returning 
exactly 0 under both discounting regimes i.e. under USD collateralization with 
direct curve building and under EUR collateralization with the discount ratio 
modified ``GBP-IN-EUR'' curve.

Also, in this example, an assumption is made that there are no direct GBP/EUR FX 
forward or cross currency quotes available which in general is false. The example 
s merely for illustration.

Both collateralizaton scenarios can be run calling {\tt python run.py}.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Curve Building using Fixed vs. Float Cross Currency Helpers}% Example 29
\label{example:29}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_29} demonstrates using fixed vs. float 
cross currency swap helpers. In particular, it builds a TRY collateralised in USD 
discount curve using TRY annual fixed vs USD 3M Libor swap quotes.

The portfolio contains an at-market fixed vs. float cross currency swap that is 
included in the curve building. The NPV of this swap should be zero when the example is run,
using {\tt python run.py} or ``directly'' calling {\tt ore[.exe] ore.xml}.

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{USD-Prime Curve Building via Prime-LIBOR Basis Swap}% Example 30
\label{example:30}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_30} demonstrates the implementation of the USD-Prime index in the ORE.
The USD-Prime yield curve is built from USD-Prime vs USD 3M Libor basis swap quotes.
The portfolio consists of two fair basis swaps (NPVs equal to 0):
\begin{itemize}
\item US Dollar Prime Rate vs 3 Month LIBOR
\item US Dollar 3 Month LIBOR vs Fed Funds + 0.027
\end{itemize}

In particular, it is confirmed that the bootstrapped curves USD-FedFunds and USD-Prime follow
the 3\% rule observed on the market: {\tt U.S. Prime Rate = (The Fed Funds Target Rate + 3\%)}.
(See \url{http://www.fedprimerate.com/}.)

Running ORE in directory {\tt Examples/Example\_30} with {\tt python run.py }
yields the USD-Prime curve in {\tt Examples/Example\_30/Output/curves.csv.}

%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Exposure Simulation using a Close-Out Grid}% Example 31
\label{example:31}
%--------------------------------------------------------

In the previous examples we have used a ``lagged'' approach, described at the end of appendix \ref{sec:app_collateral}, to take the Margin Period of Risk into account in exposure modelling. This has the disadvantage in ORE that we need to use equally-spaced time grids with time steps that match the MPoR, e.g. 2W, out to final portfolio maturity. 

In this example we demonstrate an alternative approach supported by ORE since release 6. In this approach we use two nested grids: The (almost) arbitrary main simulation grid is used to compute ``default values'' which feed into the collateral balance $C(t)$ filtered by MTA and Threshold etc; an auxiliary ``close-out'' grid, offset from the main grid by the MPoR, is used to compute the delayed close-out values $V(t)$ associated with time default time $t$. The difference between $V(t)$ and $C(t)$ causes a residual exposure $[V(t)-C(t)]^+$ even if minimum transfer amounts and thresholds are zero.

The close-out date value can be computed in two ways in ORE
\begin{itemize}
\item as of default date, by just evolving the market from default date to close-out date
   (``sticky date''), or 
\item  as of close-out date, by evolving both valuation date and market over the 
   close-out period (``actual date''), i.e., the portfolio ages and cash flows might occur
   in the close-out period causing spikes in the evolution of exposures. 
\end{itemize}

We are reusing one case from Example 10 here, perfect CSA with zero threshold and

effect. The portfolio consists of a single at-the-money Swap in GBP.

\subsection{Inflation Swap Exposure under Jarrow-Yildrim}% Example 32
\label{example:32}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

The example here is similar to that in Section \ref{example:17} in that we are generating exposures for inflation swaps. The example in Section \ref{example:17} uses the Dodgson-Kainth model whereas this example uses the Jarrow-Yildrim model. The valuation date is 5 Oct 2020 and the portfolio contains four spot starting inflation swaps:

\begin{itemize}
\item trade\_01: 20Y standard UKRPI ZCIIS struck at the fair market rate of 3.1925\% giving an NPV of 0.0. 
\item trade\_02: 20Y standard EUHICPXT ZCIIS struck at the fair market rate of 1.16875\% giving an NPV of 0.0.
\item trade\_03: 20Y year on year EUHICPXT swap.
\item trade\_04: 20Y year on year UKRPI swap.
\end{itemize}

The example generates cash flows, NPVs, exposure evolutions and XVAs.

\subsection{CDS Exposure Simulation}% Example 33
\label{example:33}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_33} is the credit variant of the example in
\ref{sec:example1}. Running ORE in directory {\tt Examples/Example\_33} with

\medskip
\centerline{\tt python run.py } 
\medskip

yields the exposure evolution in 

\medskip
\centerline{\tt Examples/Example\_33/Output/*.pdf } 
\medskip

and shown in figure \ref{fig_33}. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{mpl_cds_33_2w_10k.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Credit Default Swap expected exposure in a flat market environment from both parties' perspectives. The symbols are CDS Option prices. The simulation was run with bi-weekly time steps and 10,000 Monte Carlo samples to demonstrate the convergence of EPE and ENE profiles. A similar
outcome can be obtained more quickly with 5,000 samples on a monthly time grid which is the default setting of Example\_33. }
\label{fig_33}
\end{figure}
Both CDS simulation and CDS Option pricing are run with calls to the ORE executable, essentially 

\medskip
\centerline{\tt ore[.exe] ore.xml} 

\centerline{\tt ore[.exe] ore\_cds\_option.xml} 
\medskip

which are wrapped into the script {\tt Examples/Example\_33/run.py} provided with the ORE release.

This example demonstrates credit simulation using the LGM model and the calculation of Wrong Way Risk due to credit
correlation between the underlying entity of the CDS and the counterparty of the CDS trade via dynamic credit.
Positive correlation between the two names weakens the protection of the CDS whilst
negative correlation strengthens the protection.

The following table lists the XVA result from the example at different levels of correlation.

\subsection{Wrong Way Risk}% Example 34
\label{example:34}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_34} is an extension of the example in
\ref{sec:example1} with dynamic credit and IR-CR correlation. As we are paying
float, negative correlation implies that we pay more when the counterparty's credit
worsens, leading to a surge of CVA.

The following table lists the XVA result from the example at different levels of correlation.

\subsection{Flip View}% Example 35
\label{example:35}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_35} demonstrates how ORE can be used to quickly switch perspectives in XVA calculations with minimal changes in the {\tt ore.xml} file only. In particular it does not involve manipulating the portfolio input or the netting set.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Choice of Measure}% Example 36
\label{example:36}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_36} illustrates the effect of measure changes on simulated expected and peak exposures. For that purpose we reuse Example 1 (un-collateralized vanilla swap exposure) and run the simulation three times with different risk-neutral measures,
\begin{itemize}
\item in the LGM measure as in Example 1 (note {\tt <Measure>LGM</Measure>} in {\tt simulation\_lgm.xml}, this is the default also if the Measure tag is omitted)  
\item in the more common Bank Account measure (note {\tt <Measure>BA</Measure>} in {\tt simulation\_ba.xml})  
\item in the T-Forward measure with horizon T=20 at the Swap maturity (note {\tt <Measure>LGM</Measure>}  and {\tt <ShiftHorizon>20.0</ShiftHorizon>} in {\tt simulation\_fwd.xml})
\end{itemize}

The results are summarized in the exposure evolution graphs in figure \ref{fig:36}. As expected, the expected exposures evolutions match across measures, as these are expected discounted NPVs and hence measure independent.
However, peak exposures are dependent on the measure choice as confirmed graphically here. Many more measures are accessible with ORE, by way of varying the T-Forward horizon which was chosen arbitrarily here to match the Swap's maturity.

\subsection{Multifactor Hull-White Scenario Generation}% Example 37
\label{example:37}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_37} illustrates the scenario generation under a Hull-White multifactor
model. The model is driven by two independent Brownian motions and has four states. The diffusion matrix sigma is
therefore 2 x 4. The reversion matrix is a 4 x 4 diagonal matrix and entered as an array. Both diffusion and reversion
are constant in time. Their values are not calibrated to the option market, but hardcoded in simulation.xml.

The values for the diffusion and reversion matrices were fitted to the first two principal components of a
(hypothetical) analyis of absolute rate curve movements. These input principal components can be found in
inputeigenvectors.csv in the input folder. The tenor is given in years, and the two components are given as column
vectors, see table \ref{tab:ex37_1}.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|r|r}
tenor & eigenvector 1  & eigenvector 2   \\
\hline      
1     & 0.353553390593 & -0.537955502871 \\
2     & 0.353553390593 & -0.374924478795 \\
3     & 0.353553390593 & -0.252916811525 \\

30    & 0.353553390593 & 0.552478951238
\end{tabular}
\caption{Input principal components}
\label{tab:ex37_1}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The first eigenvector represent perfectly parallel movements. The second eigenvector represent a rotation around the 7y
point of the curve. Furthermore we prescribe an annual volatility of 0.0070 for the first components and 0.0030 for the
second one. The values can be compared to normal (bp) volatilities.

We follow \cite{Andersen_Piterbarg_2010} chapter 12.1.5 ``Multi-Factor Statistical Gaussian Model'' to calibrate the
diffusion and reversion matrices to the prescribed components and volatilities. We do not detail the procedure here and
refer the interested reader to the given reference.

The example generates a single monte carlo path with 5000 daily steps and outputs the generated scenarios in
scenariodump.csv. The python script pca.py performs a principal component analysis on this output. The model implied
eigenvalues are given in table \ref{tab:ex37_2}.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|r}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Input principal components}

Only the first two values are relevant, the following are all close to zero. The square root of the first two
eigenvalues is given in table \ref{tab:ex37_3}.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|r}

matching the prescribed input values of 0.0070 and 0.0030 quite well. The correpsonding eigenvectors are given in etable
\ref{tab:ex37_4}.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|r|r}

again matching the input principal components quite well. The second eigenvector is the negative of the input vector
here (the principal compoennt analysis can not distinguish these of course).

The example also produces a plot comparing the input eigenvectors and the model implied eigenvectors as shown in figure \ref{fig:ex37}.

\subsection{Cross Currency Swap Exposure using Multifactor Hull-White Models}% Example 38
\label{example:38}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

The example in folder {\tt Examples/Example\_38} is similar to Example 8 (EPE, ENE for xccy swap), but uses a
multifactor HW model for EUR and USD to generate scenarios. The parametrization of the HW models is taken from Example
37.

Each of the two factors of each HW model is correlated with each of the two factors of the other currency's HW model and
with the FX factors. Remember that the factors represent principal components of interest rate movements and so the
correlations can be interpreted as correlations of these principal components with each other and the fx rate processes.

\section{Launchers and Visualisation}\label{sec:visualisation}
%========================================================

\subsection{Jupyter}\label{sec:jupyter}

ORE comes with an experimental Jupyter notebook for launching ORE batches and in particular for drilling into NPV cube
data.  The notebook is located in directory {\tt FrontEnd/Python/Visualization/npvcube}. To launch the notebook, change
to this directory and follow instructions in the {\tt Readme.txt}. In a nutshell, type\footnote{With Mac OS X, you may
  need to set the environment variable {\tt LANG} to {\tt en\_US.UTF-8} before running jupyter, as mentioned in the
  installation section \ref{sec:python}.}

\medskip
\centerline{\tt jupyter notebook}
\medskip

to start the ipython console and open a browser window. From the list of files displayed in the browser then click

\medskip
\centerline{\tt ore\_jupyter\_dashboard.ipynb} 
\medskip

to open the ORE notebook. The notebook offers
\begin{itemize}
\item launching an ORE job
\item selecting an NPV cube file and netting sets or trades therein
\item plotting a 3d exposure probability density surface
\item viewing exposure probability density function at a selected future time
\item viewing expected exposure evolution through time  
\end{itemize}

The cube file loaded here by default when processing all cells of the notebook (without changing it or launching a ORE
batch) is taken from {\tt Example\_7} (FX Forwards and FX Options).

%\todo[inline]{Add Jupyter section}

\subsection{Calc}\label{sec:calc}

ORE comes with a simple LibreOffice Calc \cite{LO} sheet as an ORE launcher and basic result viewer. This is
demonstrated on the example in section \ref{sec:example1}. It is currently based on the stable LibreOffice version 5.0.6
and tested on OS X. \\

To launch Calc, open a terminal, change to directory {\tt Examples/Example\_1}, and run

\medskip
{\centerline{\tt ./launchCalc.sh} }
\medskip

%This will show the blank sheet in figure \ref{fig_14}.
%\begin{figure}[h]
%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{demo_calc_1}
%\end{center}
%\caption{Calc sheet after launching.}
%\label{fig_14}
%\end{figure}
The user can choose a configuration (one of the {\tt ore*.xml} files in Example\_1's subfolder Input) by hitting the
'Select' button. Initially Input/ore.xml is pre-selected. The ORE process is then kicked off by hitting 'Run'. Once
completed, standard ORE reports (NPV, Cashflow, XVA) are loaded into several sheets. Moreover, exposure evolutions can
then be viewed by hitting 'View' which shows the result in figure \ref{fig_16}.  \\
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{demo_calc_2}
\end{center}
\caption{Calc sheet after hitting 'Run'.}
\label{fig_16}
\end{figure}

This demo uses simple Libre Office Basic macros which call Python scripts to execute ORE. The Libre Office Python uno
module (which comes with Libre Office) is used to communicate between Python and Calc to upload results into the sheets.

%\todo[inline]{Harmonise layout with Excel launcher} 

\subsection{Excel}\label{sec:excel}

ORE also comes with a basic Excel sheet to demonstrate launching ORE and presenting results in Excel. This demo is more
self-contained than the Calc demo in the previous section, as it uses VBA only rather than calls to external Python
scripts. The Excel demo is available in Example\_1. Launch {\tt Example\_1.xlsm}. Then modify the paths on the first
sheet, and kick off the ORE process.

%========================================================
\section{Parameterisation}\label{sec:configuration}
%========================================================

A run of ORE is kicked off with a single command line parameter 

\medskip
\centerline{\tt ore[.exe] ore.xml}
\medskip

which points to the 'master input file' referred to  as {\tt ore.xml} subsequently. 
This file is the starting point of the engine's configuration explained in the following sub section.
An overview of all input configuration files respectively all output files is shown in Table \ref{tab_1} respectively Table \ref{tab_2}.
To set up your own ORE configuration, it might be not be necessary to start from scratch, but instead use any of the examples discussed in section \ref{sec:examples} as a boilerplate and just change the folders, see section \ref{sec:master_input}, and the trade data, see section \ref{sec:portfolio_data}, together with the netting definitions, see section \ref{sec:nettingsetinput}.

\subsection{Master Input File: {\tt ore.xml}}\label{sec:master_input}

The master input file contains general setup information (paths to configuration, trade data and market data), as well
as the selection and configuration of analytics. The file has an opening and closing root element {\tt <ORE>}, {\tt
  </ORE>} with three sections
\begin{itemize}
\item Setup
\item Markets
\item Analytics
\end{itemize}
which we will explain in the following.

\subsubsection{Setup}

This subset of data is easiest explained using an example, see listing \ref{lst:ore_setup}.
\begin{listing}[H]

\caption{ORE setup example}
\label{lst:ore_setup}
\end{listing}

Parameter names are self explanatory: Input and output path are interpreted relative from the directory where the ORE
executable is executed, but can also be specified using absolute paths. All file names are then interpreted relative to the
'inputPath' and 'outputPath', respectively. The files starting with {\tt ../../Input/} then point to files in the global
Example input directory {\tt Example/Input/*}, whereas files such as {\tt portfolio.xml} are local inputs in {\tt 
Example/Example\_\#/Input/}. 

Parameter {\tt logMask} determines the verbosity of log file output. Log messages are 
internally labelled as Alert, Critical, Error, Warning, Notice, Debug, associated with logMask values 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 64. 
The logMask allows filtering subsets of these categories and controlling the verbosity of log file output\footnote{by bitwise comparison of the the external logMask value with each message's log level}. LogMask 255 ensures maximum verbosity. \\

When ORE starts, it will initialise today's market, i.e. load market data, fixings and dividends, and build all term
structures as specified in {\tt todaysmarket.xml}.  Moreover, ORE will load the trades in {\tt portfolio.xml} and link
them with pricing engines as specified in {\tt pricingengine.xml}. When parameter {\tt implyTodaysFixings} is set to Y,
today's fixings would not be loaded but implied, relevant when pricing/bootstrapping off hypothetical market data as
e.g. in scenario analysis and stress testing. The curveConfigFile {\tt curveconfig.xml}, the conventionsFile {\tt
  conventions.xml}, the referenceDataFile {\tt referencedata.xml}, the iborFallbackConfig, the marketDataFile and the
fixingDataFile are explained in the sections below.

\medskip Parameter {\tt calendarAdjustment} includes the {\tt calendarAdjustment.xml} which lists out additional holidays and
business days to be added to specified calendars.

\medskip The optional parameter {\tt currencyConfiguration} points to a configuration file that contains additional currencies
to be added to ORE's setup, see {\tt Examples/Input/currencies.xml} for a full list of ISO currencies and a few unofficial currency
codes that can thus be made available in ORE. Note that the external configuration does not override any currencies that are
hard-coded in the QuantLib/QuantExt libraries, only currencies not present already are added from the external configuration file.

\medskip The last parameter {\tt observationModel} can be used to control ORE performance during simulation. The choices
{\em Disable } and {\em Unregister } yield similarly improved performance relative to choice {\em None}. For users
familiar with the QuantLib design - the parameter controls to which extent {\em QuantLib observer notifications} are
used when market and fixing data is updated and the evaluation date is shifted:
\begin{itemize}
\item The 'Unregister' option limits the amount of notifications by unregistering floating rate coupons from indices;
\item Option 'Defer' disables all notifications during market data and fixing updates with
{\tt ObservableSettings::instance().disableUpdates(true)}
and kicks off updates afterwards when enabled again
\item The 'Disable' option goes one step further and disables all notifications during market data and fixing updates,
  and in particular when the evaluation date is changed along a path, with \\
  {\tt ObservableSettings::instance().disableUpdates(false)} \\
  Updates are not deferred here. Required term structure and instrument recalculations are triggered explicitly.
\end{itemize}
%\todo[inline]{Expand the technical description of observationModel}

\medskip If the parameter {\tt lazyMarketBuilding} is set to true, the build of the curves in the TodaysMarket is
delayed until they are actually requested. This can speed up the processing when some curves configured in TodaysMarket
are not used. If not given, the parameter defaults to {\tt true}.

\medskip If the parameter {\tt continueOnError} is set to true, the application will not exit on an error, but try to
continue the processing. If not given, the parameter defaults to {\tt false}.

\medskip If the parameter {\tt buildFailedTrades} is set to true, the application will build a dummy trade if loading or
building the original trade fails. The dummy trade has trade type ``Failed'', zero notional and NPV.
If not given, the parameter defaults to {\tt false}.

\subsubsection{Markets}\label{sec:master_input_markets}

The {\tt Markets} section (see listing \ref{lst:ore_markets}) is used to choose market configurations for calibrating
the IR, FX and EQ simulation model components, pricing and simulation, respectively. These configurations have to be 
defined
in {\tt todaysmarket.xml} (see section \ref{sec:market}).

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<Markets>
  <Parameter name="lgmcalibration">collateral_inccy</Parameter>
  <Parameter name="fxcalibration">collateral_eur</Parameter>

  <Parameter name="simulation">collateral_eur</Parameter>
</Markets>
\end{minted}
%\hrule
\caption{ORE markets}
\label{lst:ore_markets}
\end{listing}

For example, the calibration of the simulation model's interest rate components requires local OIS discounting whereas
the simulation phase requires cross currency adjusted discount curves to get FX product pricing right. So far, the
market configurations are used only to distinguish discount curve sets, but the market configuration concept in ORE
applies to all term structure types.

\subsubsection{Analytics}\label{sec:analytics}

The {\tt Analytics} section lists all permissible analytics using tags {\tt <Analytic type="..."> ... </Analytic>} where
type can be (so far) in
\begin{itemize}
\item npv
\item cashflow
\item additionalResults
\item todaysMarketCalibration
\item curves
\item simulation
\item xva
\item sensitivity
\item stress
\end{itemize}

Each {\tt Analytic} section contains a list of key/value pairs to parameterise the analysis of the form {\tt <Parameter
  name="key">value</Parameter>}. Each analysis must have one key {\tt active} set to Y or N to activate/deactivate this
analysis.  The following listing \ref{lst:ore_analytics} shows the parametrisation of the first four basic analytics in
the list above.

\caption{ORE analytics: npv, cashflow, curves, additional results, todays market calibration}
\label{lst:ore_analytics}
\end{listing}

The cashflow analytic writes a report containing all future cashflows of the portfolio. Table \ref{cashflowreport} shows
a typical output for a vanilla swap.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\scriptsize
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|r|l|r|r|l|r|r}
\hline
\#ID & Type & LegNo & PayDate & Amount & Currency & Coupon & Accrual & fixingDate & fixingValue & Notional \\
\hline
\hline
tr123 & Swap & 0 & 13/03/17 & -111273.76 & EUR & -0.00201 & 0.50556 & 08/09/16 & -0.00201 & 100000000.00 \\

\ldots
\end{tabular}
\caption{Cashflow Report}
\label{cashflowreport}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The amount column contains the projected amount including embedded caps and floors and convexity (if applicable), the
coupon column displays the corresponding rate estimation. The fixing value on the other hand is the plain fixing
projection as given by the forward value, i.e. without embedded caps and floors or convexity.

Note that the fixing value might deviate from the coupon value even for a vanilla coupon, if the QuantLib library was
compiled {\em without} the flag \verb+QL_USE_INDEXED_COUPON+ (which is the default case). In this case the coupon value
uses a par approximation for the forward rate assuming the index estimation period to be identical to the accrual
period, while the fixing value is the actual forward rate for the index estimation period, i.e. whenever the index estimation
period differs from the accrual period the values will be slightly different.

The Notional column contains the underlying notional used to compute the amount of each coupon. It contains \verb+#NA+
if a payment is not a coupon payment.

The curves analytic exports all yield curves that have been built according to the specification in {\tt
  todaysmarket.xml}. Key {\tt configuration} selects the curve set to be used (see explanation in the previous Markets
section).  Key {\tt grid} defines the time grid on which the yield curves are evaluated, in the example above a grid of
240 monthly time steps from today. The discount factors for all curves with configuration default will be exported on
this monthly grid into the csv file specified by key {\tt outputFileName}. The grid can also be specified explicitly by
a comma separated list of tenor points such as {\tt 1W, 1M, 2M, 3M, \dots}.

The additionalResults analytic writes a report containing any additional results generated for the portfolio. The results are pricing engine specific but Table \ref{additionalreport} shows the output for a vanilla swaption.

\begin{table}[hbt]
\scriptsize
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l}

\end{tabular}
\caption{AdditionalResults Report}
\label{additionalreport}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The todaysMarketCalibration analytic writes a report containing information on the build of the t0 market.

\medskip The purpose of the {\tt simulation} 'analytics' is to run a Monte Carlo simulation which evolves the market as
specified in the simulation config file. The primary result is an NPV cube file, i.e. valuations of all trades in the
portfolio file (see section Setup), for all future points in time on the simulation grid and for all paths. Apart from
the NPV cube, additional scenario data (such as simulated overnight rates etc) are stored in this process which are
needed for subsequent XVA analytics.

\caption{ORE analytic: simulation}
\label{lst:ore_simulation}
\end{listing}

The pricing engines file specifies how trades are priced under future scenarios which can differ from pricing as of
today (specified in section Setup).  Key base currency determines into which currency all NPVs will be converted. Key
store scenarios (Y or N) determines whether the market scenarios are written to a file for later reuse. Key
`store flows' (Y or N) controls whether cumulative cash flows between simulation dates are stored in the (hyper-)
cube for post processing in the context of Dynamic Initial Margin and Variation Margin calculations. And finally, the
key `store survival probabilities' (Y or N) controls whether survival probabilities on simulation dates are stored in the
cube for post processing in the context of Dynamic Credit XVA calculation. The additional
scenario data (written to the specified file here) is likewise required in the post processor step. These data comprise
simulated index fixing e.g. for collateral compounding and simulated FX rates for cash collateral conversion into base
currency. The scenario dump file, if specified here, causes ORE to write simulated market data to a human-readable csv
file. Only those currencies or indices are written here that are stated in the AggregationScenarioDataCurrencies and 
AggregationScenarioDataIndices subsections of the simulation files market section, see also section
\ref{sec:sim_market}.
 
\medskip The XVA analytic section offers CVA, DVA, FVA and COLVA calculations which can be selected/deselected here
individually. All XVA calculations depend on a previously generated NPV cube (see above) which is referenced here via
the {\tt cubeFile} parameter. This means one can re-run the XVA analytics without regenerating the cube each time. The
XVA reports depend in particular on the settings in the {\tt csaFile} which determines CSA details such as margining
frequency, collateral thresholds, minimum transfer amounts, margin period of risk. By splitting the processing into
pre-processing (cube generation) and post-processing (aggregation and XVA analysis) it is possible to vary these CSA
details and analyse their impact on XVAs quickly without re-generating the NPV cube.

transfer amounts, margin period of risk
\item {\tt cubeFile:} NPV cube file previously generated and to be post-processed here
\item {\tt hyperCube:} If set to N, the cube file is expected to have depth 1 (storing NPV data only), if set to Y it is
expected to have depth $>$ 1 (e.g. storing NPVs and cumulative flows)
\item {\tt scenarioFile:} Scenario data previously generated and used in the post-processor (simulated index fixings and
FX rates)
\item {\tt baseCurrency:} Expression currency for all NPVs, value adjustments, exposures

	\todo[inline]{Move calculationType into the {\tt csaFile}?}
\item {\tt allocationMethod:} XVA allocation method, choices are {\em None, Marginal, RelativeXVA, RelativeFairValueGross, RelativeFairValueNet}
\item {\tt marginalAllocationLimit:} The marginal allocation method a la Pykhtin/Rosen breaks down when the netting set
value vanishes while the exposure does not. This parameter acts as a cutoff for the marginal allocation when the
absolute netting set value falls below this limit and switches to equal distribution of the exposure in this case.
\item {\tt exerciseNextBreak:} Flag to terminate all trades at their next break date before aggregation and the
subsequent analytics

\item {\tt kvaCapitalDiscountRate, kvaAlpha, kvaRegAdjustment, kvaCapitalHurdle, kvaOurPdFloor, kvaTheirPdFloor kvaOurCvaRiskWeight, kvaTheirCvaRiskWeight:} the kva CCR parameters (see \ref{sec:app_kva} and \ref{sec:app_kva_cva}.
\item {\tt dimQuantile:} Quantile for Dynamic Initial Margin (DIM) calculation
\item {\tt dimHorizonCalendarDays:} Horizon for DIM calculation, 14 calendar days for 2 weeks, etc.
\item {\tt dimRegressionOrder:} Order of the regression polynomial (netting set clean NPV move over the simulation
period versus netting set NPV at period start)
\item {\tt dimRegressors:} Variables used as regressors in a single- or multi-dimensional regression; these variable
  names need to match entries in the {\tt simulation.xml}'s AggregationScenarioDataCurrencies and
  AggregationScenarioDataIndices sections (only these scenario data are passed on to the post processor); if the list is
  empty, the NPV will be used as a single regressor
\item {\tt dimLocalRegressionEvaluations:} Nadaraya-Watson local regression evaluated at the given number of points to
validate polynomial regression. Note that Nadaraya-Watson needs a large number of samples for meaningful
results. Evaluating the local regression at many points (samples) has a significant performance impact, hence the option
here to limit the number of evaluations.

independent variable (NPV)
\item {\tt dimScaling:} Scaling factor applied to all DIM values used, e.g. to reconcile simulated DIM with actual IM at
$t_0$
\item {\tt dimEvolutionFile:} Output file name to store the evolution of zero order DIM and average of nth order DIM
through time
\item {\tt dimRegressionFiles:} Output file name(s) for a DIM regression snapshot, comma separated list
\item {\tt dimOutputNettingSet:} Netting set for the DIM regression snapshot
\item {\tt dimOutputGridPoints:} Grid point(s) (in time) for the DIM regression snapshot, comma separated list
\item {\tt rawCubeOutputFile:} File name for the trade NPV cube in human readable csv file format (per trade, date,
sample), leave empty to skip generation of this file.
\item {\tt netCubeOutputFile:} File name for the aggregated NPV cube in human readable csv file format (per netting set,
date, sample) {\em after} taking collateral into account. Leave empty to skip generation of this file.
\item {\tt fullInitialCollateralisation:} If set to {\tt true}, then for every netting set, the collateral balance at $t=0$ will be set to the NPV of the setting set. The resulting effect is that EPE, ENE and PFE are all zero at $t=0$. If set to {\tt false} (default value), then the collateral balance at $t=0$ will be set to zero.
\item {\tt flipViewXVA:} If set to {\tt Y}, the perspective in XVA calculations is switched to the cpty view, the npvs and the netting sets being reverted during calculation. In order to get the lending/borrowing curve, the calculation assumes these curves being set up with the cptyname + the postfix given in the next two settings.
\item {\tt flipViewBorrowingCurvePostfix:} postfix for the borrowing curve, the calculation assumes this is curves being set up with cptyname + postfix given.
\item {\tt flipViewLendingCurvePostfix:} postfix for the lending curve, the calculation assumes this is curve being set up with cptyname + postfix given.
\end{itemize}

The two cube file outputs {\tt rawCubeOutputFile} and {\tt netCubeOutputFile} are provided for interactive analysis and visualisation purposes, see section
\ref{sec:visualisation}.

\medskip The {\tt sensitivity} and {\tt stress} 'analytics' provide computation of bump and revalue (zero rate
resp. optionlet) sensitivities and NPV changes under user defined stress scenarios. Listing \ref{lst:ore_sensitivity}
shows a typical configuration for sensitivity calculation.

\begin{listing}[H]

The parameters have the following interpretation:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt marketConfigFile:} Configuration file defining the simulation market under which sensitivities are computed,
  see \ref{sec:simulation}. Only a subset of the specification is needed (the one given under {\tt Market}, see
  \ref{sec:sim_market} for a detailed description).
\item {\tt sensitivityConfigFile:} Configuration file  for the sensitivity calculation, see section \ref{sec:sensitivity}.
\item {\tt pricingEnginesFile:} Configuration file for the pricing engines to be used for sensitivity calculation.
\item {\tt scenarioOutputFile:} File containing the results of the sensitivity calculation in terms of the base scenario
  NPV, the scenario NPV and their difference.
\item {\tt sensitivityOutputFile:} File containing the results of the sensitivity calculation in terms of the base scenario
  NPV, the shift size together with the risk-factor and the resulting first and (pure) second order finite differences.
  Also included is a second set of shift sizes together with the risk-factor with a (mixed) second order finite difference associated to a cross gamma calculation
%\item {\tt parRateSensitivityOutputFile:} File containing par sensitivities (only available in ORE+)
\item {\tt outputSensitivityThreshold:} Only finite differences with absolute value greater than this number are written
  to the output files.
\item {\tt recalibrateModels:} If set to Y, then recalibrate pricing models after each shift of relevant term structures; otherwise do not recalibrate
\end{itemize}

The stress analytics configuration is similar to the one of the sensitivity calculation. Listing \ref{lst:ore_stress}
shows an example.

\begin{listing}[H]

The parameters have the same interpretation as for the sensitivity analytic. The configuration file for the stress
scenarios is described in more detail in section \ref{sec:stress}.

\medskip The {\tt VaR} 'analytics' provide computation of Value-at-Risk measures based on the sensitivity (delta, gamma, cross gamma) data above. Listing \ref{lst:ore_var} shows a configuration example.

\end{minted}
\caption{ORE analytic: VaR}
\label{lst:ore_var}
\end{listing}

The parameters have the following interpretation:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\t portfolioFilter:} Regular expression used to filter the portfolio for which VaR is computed; if the filter is not provided, then the full portfolio is processed
\item {\tt sensitivityInputFile:} Reference to the sensitivity (deltas, vegas, gammas) and cross gamma input as generated by ORE in a comma separated list
\item {\tt covarianceFile:} Reference to the covariances input data; these are currently not calculated in ORE and need to be provided externally, in a blank/tab/comma separated file with three columns (factor1, factor2, covariance), where factor1 and factor2 follow the naming convention used in ORE's sensitivity and cross gamma output files. Covariances need to be consistent with the sensitivity data provided. For example, if sensitivity to factor1 is computed by absolute shifts and expressed in basis points, then the covariances with factor1 need to be based on absolute basis point shifts of factor1; if sensitivity is due to a relative factor1 shift of 1\%, then covariances with factor1 need to be based on relative shifts expressed in percentages to, etc. Also note that covariances are expected to include the desired holding period, i.e. no scaling with square root of time etc is performed in ORE; 
\item {\tt salvageCovarianceMatrix:} If set to Y, turn the input covariance matrix into a valid (positive definite) matrix applying a Salvaging algorithm; if set to N, throw an exception if the matrix is not positive definite
\item {\tt quantiles:} Several desired quantiles can be specified here in a comma separated list; these lead to several columns of results in the output file, see below. Note that e.g. the 1\% quantile corresponds to the lower tail of the P\&L distribution (VaR), 99\% to the upper tail.
\item {\tt breakdown:} If yes, VaR is computed by portfolio, risk class (All, Interest Rate, FX, Inflation, Equity, Credit) and risk type (All, Delta \& Gamma, Vega)
\item {\tt method:} Choices are {\em Delta, DeltaGammaNormal, MonteCarlo}, see appendix \ref{sec:app_var}
\item {\tt mcSamples:} Number of Monte Carlo samples used when the {\em MonteCarlo} method is chosen 
\item {\tt mcSeed:} Random number generator seed when the {\em MonteCarlo} method is chosen
\item {\tt outputFile:} Output file name

This configuration file determines the subset of the 'market' universe which is going to be built by ORE. It is the
user's responsibility to make sure that this subset is sufficient to cover the portfolio to be analysed. If it is not,
the application will complain at run time and exit.

\medskip We assume that the market configuration is provided in file {\tt todaysmarket.xml}, however, the file name can
be chosen by the user. The file name needs to be entered into the master configuration file {\tt ore.xml}, see section
\ref{sec:master_input}.

\medskip 
The file starts and ends with the opening and closing tags {\tt <TodaysMarket>} 
and {\tt </TodaysMarket>}. The file then contains configuration blocks for
\begin{itemize}
\item Discounting curves
\item Index curves (to project index fixings)
\item Yield curves (for other purposes, e.g. as benchmark curve for bond pricing)
\item Swap index curves (to project Swap rates)
\item FX spot rates
\item Inflation index curves (to project zero or yoy inflation fixings)
\item Equity curves (to project forward prices)
\item Default curves
\item Swaption volatility structures
\item Cap/Floor volatility structures
\item FX volatility structures
\item Inflation Cap/Floor volatility surfaces
\item Equity volatility structures
\item CDS volatility structures
\item Base correlation structures
\item Correlation structures
\item Securities
\end{itemize}

There can be alternative versions of each block each labeled with a unique identifier (e.g. Discount curve block with ID
'default', discount curve block with ID 'ois', another one with ID 'xois', etc). The purpose of these IDs will be
explained at the end of this section. We now discuss each block's layout.

\subsubsection{Discounting Curves} 

We pick one discounting curve block as an example here (see {\tt Examples/Input/todaysmarket.xml}), the one with ID 'ois' 

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
  <DiscountingCurves id="ois">
    <DiscountingCurve currency="EUR">Yield/EUR/EUR1D</DiscountingCurve>
    <DiscountingCurve currency="USD">Yield/USD/USD1D</DiscountingCurve>
    <DiscountingCurve currency="GBP">Yield/GBP/GBP1D</DiscountingCurve>
    <DiscountingCurve currency="CHF">Yield/CHF/CHF6M</DiscountingCurve>
    <DiscountingCurve currency="JPY">Yield/JPY/JPY6M</DiscountingCurve>
    <!-- ... -->
  </DiscountingCurves>
\end{minted}
\caption{Discount curve block with ID 'ois'}
\label{lst:discountcurve_spec}
\end{listing}

This block instructs ORE to build five discount curves for the indicated currencies. The string within the tags,
e.g. Yield/EUR/EUR1D, uniquely identifies the curve to be built.  Curve Yield/EUR/EUR1D is defined in the curve
configuration file explained in section \ref{sec:curveconfig} below. In this case ORE is instructed to build an Eonia
Swap curve made of Overnight Deposit and Eonia Swap quotes. The right most token of the string Yield/EUR/EUR1D (EUR1D)
is user defined, the first two tokens Yield/EUR have to be used to point to a yield curve in currency EUR.
 
\subsubsection{Index Curves} 

See an excerpt of the index curve block with ID 'default' from the same example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<IndexForwardingCurves id="default">
  <Index name="EUR-EURIBOR-3M">Yield/EUR/EUR3M</Index>
  <Index name="EUR-EURIBOR-6M">Yield/EUR/EUR6M</Index>
  <Index name="EUR-EURIBOR-12M">Yield/EUR/EUR12M</Index>
  <Index name="EUR-EONIA">Yield/EUR/EUR1D</Index>
  <Index name="USD-LIBOR-3M">Yield/USD/USD3M</Index>
  <!-- ... -->
</IndexForwardingCurves>
\end{minted}
\caption{Index curve block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:indexcurve_spec}
\end{listing}

This block of curve specifications instructs ORE to build another set of yield curves, unique strings
(e.g. Yield/EUR/EUR6M etc.) point to the {\tt curveconfig.xml} file where these curves are defined. Each curve is then
associated with an index name (of format Ccy-IndexName-Tenor, e.g. EUR-EURIBOR-6M) so that ORE will project the
respective index using the selected curve (e.g. Yield/EUR/EUR6M).

\subsubsection{Yield Curves}

See an excerpt of the yield curve block with ID 'default' from the same example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<YieldCurves id="default">
  <YieldCurve name="BANK_EUR_LEND">Yield/EUR/BANK_EUR_LEND</YieldCurve>
  <YieldCurve name="BANK_EUR_BORROW">Yield/EUR/BANK_EUR_BORROW</YieldCurve>
  <!-- ... -->
</YieldCurves>
\end{minted}
\caption{Yield curve block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:yieldcurve_spec}
\end{listing}

This block of curve specifications instructs ORE to build another set of yield curves, unique strings
(e.g. Yield/EUR/EUR6M etc.) point to the {\tt curveconfig.xml} file where these curves are defined. Other than
discounting and index curves the yield curves in this block are not tied to a particular purpose. The curves defined in
this block typically include

\begin{itemize}
\item additional curves needed in the XVA post processor, e.g. for the FVA calculation
\item benchmark curves used for bond pricing
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Swap Index Curves}

The following is an excerpt of the swap index curve block with ID 'default' from the same example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<SwapIndexCurves id="default">
  <SwapIndex name="EUR-CMS-1Y">
    <Index>EUR-EURIBOR-6M</Index>
    <Discounting>EUR-EONIA</Discounting>
  </SwapIndex>
  <SwapIndex name="EUR-CMS-30Y">
    <Index>EUR-EURIBOR-6M</Index>
    <Discounting>EUR-EONIA</Discounting>
  </SwapIndex>
  <!-- ... -->
</SwapIndexCurves>
\end{minted}
\caption{Swap index curve block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:swapindexcurve_spec}
\end{listing}

These instructions do not build any additional curves. They only build the respective swap index objects and associate
them with the required index forwarding and discounting curves already built above. This enables a swap index to project
the fair rate of forward starting Swaps. Swap indices are also containers for conventions. Swaption volatility surfaces
require two swap indices each available in the market object, a long term and a short term swap index. The curve
configuration file below will show that in particular the required short term index has term 1Y, and the required long
term index has 30Y term. This is why we build these two indices at this point.

\subsubsection{FX Spot}

The following is an excerpt of the FX spot block with ID 'default' from the same example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<FxSpots id="default">
  <FxSpot pair="EURUSD">FX/EUR/USD</FxSpot>
  <FxSpot pair="EURGBP">FX/EUR/GBP</FxSpot>
  <FxSpot pair="EURCHF">FX/EUR/CHF</FxSpot>
  <FxSpot pair="EURJPY">FX/EUR/JPY</FxSpot>
  <!-- ... -->
</FxSpots>
\end{minted}
\caption{FX spot block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:fxspot_spec}
\end{listing}

This block instructs ORE to provide four FX quotes, all quoted with target currency EUR so
that foreign currency amounts can be converted into EUR via multiplication with that rate.
 
\subsubsection{FX Volatilities}

The following is an excerpt of the FX Volatilities block with ID 'default' from the same example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<FxVolatilities id="default">
  <FxVolatility pair="EURUSD">FXVolatility/EUR/USD/EURUSD</FxVolatility>
  <FxVolatility pair="EURGBP">FXVolatility/EUR/GBP/EURGBP</FxVolatility>
  <FxVolatility pair="EURCHF">FXVolatility/EUR/CHF/EURCHF</FxVolatility>
  <FxVolatility pair="EURJPY">FXVolatility/EUR/JPY/EURJPY</FxVolatility>
  <!-- ... -->
</FxVolatilities>
\end{minted}
\caption{FX volatility block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:fxvol_spec}
\end{listing}

This instructs ORE to build four FX volatility structures for all FX pairs with target currency EUR, see curve
configuration file for the definition of the volatility structure.

\subsubsection{Swaption Volatilities}

The following is an excerpt of the Swaption Volatilities block with ID 'default' from the same example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<SwaptionVolatilities id="default">
  <SwaptionVolatility currency="EUR">SwaptionVolatility/EUR/EUR_SW_N</SwaptionVolatility>
  <SwaptionVolatility currency="USD">SwaptionVolatility/USD/USD_SW_N</SwaptionVolatility>
  <SwaptionVolatility currency="GBP">SwaptionVolatility/GBP/GBP_SW_N</SwaptionVolatility>
  <SwaptionVolatility currency="CHF">SwaptionVolatility/CHF/CHF_SW_N</SwaptionVolatility>
  <SwaptionVolatility currency="JPY">SwaptionVolatility/CHF/JPY_SW_N</SwaptionVolatility>
</SwaptionVolatilities>
\end{minted}
\caption{Swaption volatility block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:swaptionvol_spec}
\end{listing}

This instructs ORE to build five Swaption volatility structures, see the curve configuration file for the definition of
the volatility structure. The latter token (e.g. EUR\_SW\_N) is user defined and will be found in the curve
configuration's CurveId tag.

\subsubsection{Cap/Floor Volatilities}

The following is an excerpt of the Cap/Floor Volatilities block with ID 'default' from the same example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<CapFloorVolatilities id="default">
  <CapFloorVolatility currency="EUR">CapFloorVolatility/EUR/EUR_CF_N</CapFloorVolatility>
  <CapFloorVolatility currency="USD">CapFloorVolatility/USD/USD_CF_N</CapFloorVolatility>
  <CapFloorVolatility currency="GBP">CapFloorVolatility/GBP/GBP_CF_N</CapFloorVolatility>
</CapFloorVolatilities>
\end{minted}
\caption{Cap/Floor volatility block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:capfloorvol_spec}
\end{listing}

This instructs ORE to build three Cap/Floor volatility structures, see the curve configuration file for the definition
of the volatility structure. The latter token (e.g. EUR\_CF\_N) is user defined and will be found in the curve
configuration's CurveId tag.

\subsubsection{Default Curves}

The following is an excerpt of the Default Curves block with ID 'default' from the same example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<DefaultCurves id="default">
  <DefaultCurve name="BANK">Default/USD/BANK_SR_USD</DefaultCurve>
  <DefaultCurve name="CPTY_A">Default/USD/CUST_A_SR_USD</DefaultCurve>
  <DefaultCurve name="CPTY_B">Default/USD/CUST_A_SR_USD</DefaultCurve>
  <!-- ... -->
</DefaultCurves>
\end{minted}
\caption{Default curves block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:defaultcurve_spec}
\end{listing}

This instructs ORE to build a set of default probability curves, again defined in the curve configuration file. Each
curve is then associated with a name (BANK, CUST\_A) for subsequent lookup.  As before, the last token
(e.g. BANK\_SR\_USD) is user defined and will be found in the curve configuration's CurveId tag.

\subsubsection{Securities}\label{sssec:securities}

The following is an excerpt of the Security block with ID 'default' from the same example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
	%\hrule\medskip
	\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<Securities id="default">
  <Security name="SECURITY_1">Security/SECURITY_1</Security>
</Securities>
	\end{minted}
	\caption{Securities block with ID 'default'}
	\label{lst:secspread_spec}
\end{listing}

The pricing of bonds includes (among other components) a security specific spread and rate. 
This block links a security name to a spread and rate pair defined in the curve configuration file. This name may then be referenced 
as the security id in the bond trade definition.

\subsubsection{Equity Curves}
The following is an excerpt of the Equity curves block with ID 'default' from the same example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<EquityCurves id="default">
  <EquityCurve name="SP5">Equity/USD/SP5</EquityCurve>
  <EquityCurve name="Lufthansa">Equity/EUR/Lufthansa</EquityCurve>
</EquityCurves>
\end{minted}
\caption{Equity curves block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:eqcurve_spec}
\end{listing}

This instructs ORE to build a set of equity curves, again defined in the curve configuration file. Each equity curve 
after construction will consist of a spot equity price, as well as a term structure of dividend yields, which can be 
used to determine forward prices. This object is then associated with a name (e.g. SP5) for subsequent lookup. 

\subsubsection{Equity Volatilities}

The following is an excerpt of the equity volatilities block with ID 'default' from the same example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<EquityVolatilities id="default">
  <EquityVolatility name="SP5">EquityVolatility/USD/SP5</EquityVolatility>
  <EquityVolatility name="Lufthansa">EquityVolatility/EUR/Lufthansa</EquityVolatility>
</EquityVolatilities>
\end{minted}
\caption{EQ volatility block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:eqvol_spec}
\end{listing}

This instructs ORE to build two equity volatility structures for SP5 and Lufthansa, respectively. See the curve
configuration file for the definition of the equity volatility structure.


\subsubsection{Inflation Index Curves}

The following is an excerpt of the Zero Inflation Index Curves block with ID 'default' from the sample example file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<ZeroInflationIndexCurves id="default">
    <ZeroInflationIndexCurve name="EUHICPXT">
        Inflation/EUHICPXT/EUHICPXT_ZC_Swaps
    </ZeroInflationIndexCurve>
    <ZeroInflationIndexCurve name="FRHICP">
        Inflation/FRHICP/FRHICP_ZC_Swaps
    </ZeroInflationIndexCurve>
    <ZeroInflationIndexCurve name="UKRPI">
        Inflation/UKRPI/UKRPI_ZC_Swaps
    </ZeroInflationIndexCurve>
    <ZeroInflationIndexCurve name="USCPI">
        Inflation/USCPI/USCPI_ZC_Swaps
    </ZeroInflationIndexCurve>
    ...
</ZeroInflationIndexCurves>
\end{minted}
\caption{Zero Inflation Index Curves block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:zeroinflationindexcurve_spec}
\end{listing}

This instructs ORE to build a set of zero inflation index curves, which are defined in the curve configuration
file. Each curve is then associated with an index name (like e.g. EUHICPXT or UKRPI). The last token
(e.g. EUHICPXT\_ZC\_Swap) is user defined and will be found in the curve configuration's CurveId tag.

In a similar way, Year on Year index curves are specified:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
  <YYInflationIndexCurves id="default">
      <YYInflationIndexCurve name="EUHICPXT">
          Inflation/EUHICPXT/EUHICPXT_YY_Swaps
      </YYInflationIndexCurve>
      ...
  </YYInflationIndexCurves>
\end{minted}
\caption{YoY Inflation Index Curves block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:yoyinflationindexcurve_spec}
\end{listing}

Note that the index name is the same as in the corresponding zero index curve definition, but the token corresponding to
the CurveId tag is different. This is because the actual underlying index (and in particular its fixings) are shared
between the two index types, while different projection curves are used to forecast future index realisations.

\subsubsection{Inflation Cap/Floor Volatility Surfaces}

The following is an excerpt of the Inflation Cap/Floor Volatility Surfaces blocks with ID 'default' from the sample example
file:

{
\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
  <YYInflationCapFloorVolatilities id="default">
    <YYInflationCapFloorVolatility name="EUHICPXT">
        InflationCapFloorVolatility/EUHICPXT/EUHICPXT_YY_CF
    </InflationCapFloorVolatility>
  </YYInflationCapFloorVolatilities>

  <ZeroInflationCapFloorVolatilities id="default">
    <ZeroInflationCapFloorVolatility name="UKRPI">
        InflationCapFloorVolatility/UKRPI/UKRPI_ZC_CF
    </ZeroInflationCapFloorVolatility>
    <ZeroInflationCapFloorVolatility name="EUHICPXT">
        InflationCapFloorVolatility/EUHICPXT/EUHICPXT_ZC_CF
    </ZeroInflationCapFloorVolatility>
    <ZeroInflationCapFloorVolatility name="USCPI">
        InflationCapFloorVolatility/USCPI/USCPI_ZC_CF
    </ZeroInflationCapFloorVolatility>
  </ZeroInflationCapFloorVolatilities>
\end{minted}
\caption{Inflation Cap/Floor Volatility Surfaces block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:inflation_cap_floor_surface_spec}
\end{listing}

This instructs ORE to build a set of year-on-year and zero inflation cap floor volatility surfaces, which are defined in the curve
configuration file. Each surface is associated with an index name. The last token (e.g. EUHICPXT\_ZC\_CF) is user defined
and will be found in the curve configuration's CurveId tag.

\subsubsection{CDS Volatility Structures}

CDS volatility structures are configured as follows
\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
  <CDSVolatilities id="default">
   <CDSVolatility name="CDSVOL_A">CDSVolatility/CDXIG</CDSVolatility>
   <CDSVolatility name="CDSVOL_B">CDSVolatility/CDXHY</CDSVolatility>
  </CDSVolatilities>
\end{minted}
\caption{CDS volatility structure block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:cdsvol_spec}
\end{listing}

The composition of the CDS volatility structures is defined in the curve configuration.

\subsubsection{Base Correlation Structures}

Base correlation structures are configured as follows
\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
  <BaseCorrelations id="default">
   <BaseCorrelation name="CDXIG">BaseCorrelation/CDXIG</BaseCorrelation>
  </BaseCorrelations>
\end{minted}
\caption{Base Correlations block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:basecorr_spec}
\end{listing}

The composition of the base correlation structure is defined in the curve configuration.

\subsubsection{Correlation Structures}

Correlation structures are configured as follows
\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
 <Correlations id="default">
      <Correlation name="EUR-CMS-10Y:EUR-CMS-1Y">Correlation/EUR-CORR</Correlation>  
      <Correlation name="USD-CMS-10Y:USD-CMS-1Y">Correlation/USD-CORR</Correlation>
 </Correlations>
\end{minted}
\caption{Correlations block with ID 'default'}
\label{lst:corr_spec}
\end{listing}

The composition of the correlation structure is defined in the curve configuration.
\subsubsection{Market Configurations}

Finally, representatives of each type of block (Discount Curves, Index Curves, Volatility structures, etc, up to
Inflation Cap/Floor Price Surfaces) can be bundled into a market configuration. This is done by adding the following to
the {\tt todaysmarket.xml} file:

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<Configuration id="default">
  <DiscountingCurvesId>xois_eur</DiscountingCurvesId>
</Configuration>
<Configuration id="collateral_inccy">
  <DiscountingCurvesId>ois</DiscountingCurvesId>
</Configuration>
<Configuration id="collateral_eur">
  <DiscountingCurvesId>xois_eur</DiscountingCurvesId>
</Configuration>
<Configuration id="libor">
  <DiscountingCurvesId>inccy_swap</DiscountingCurvesId>
</Configuration>
\end{minted}
\caption{Market configurations}
\label{lst:config_spec}
\end{listing}

When ORE constructs the market object, all market configurations will be build and labelled using the 'Configuration
Id'.  This allows configuring a market setup for different alternative purposes side by side in the same {\tt
  todaysmarket.xml} file. Typical use cases are
\begin{itemize}
\item different discount curves needed for model calibration and risk factor evolution, respectively
\item different discount curves needed for collateralised and uncollateralised derivatives pricing.
\end{itemize}
The former is actually used throughout the {\tt Examples} section. Each master input file {\tt ore.xml} has a Markets
section (see \ref{sec:master_input}) where four market configuration IDs have to be provided - the ones used for
'lgmcalibration', 'fxcalibration', 'pricing' and 'simulation' (i.e. risk factor evolution).

\medskip The configuration ID concept extends across all curve and volatility objects though currently used only to
distinguish discounting.
 
%--------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Pricing Engines: {\tt pricingengine.xml}}
%--------------------------------------------------------

The pricing engine configuration file is provided to select pricing models and pricing engines by product type. The
following is an overview over the Example section's {\tt pricingengine.xml}. Further below we discuss the Bermudan Swaption engine parametrisation in more detail.

\caption{Pricing engine configuration}
\label{lst:pricingengine_config}
\end{longlisting}

These settings will be taken into account when the engine factory is asked to build the respective pricing engines and required models, and to calibrate the required model.

\medskip
For example, in case of the Bermudan Swaption, the parameters are interpreted as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The only model currently supported for Bermudan Swaption pricing is the LGM selected here. 

\item The first block of model parameters then provides initial values for the model (Reversion, Volatility) and chooses
  the parametrisation of the LGM model with ReversionType and VolatilityType choices {\em HullWhite} and {\em
    Hagan}. Notice the possibility to specify a currency-specific reversion. Calibration and BermudanStrategy can be set
  to {\em None} in order to skip model calibration. Alternatively, Calibration is set to {\em Bootstrap} and
  BermudanStrategy to {\em CoterminalATM} in order to calibrate to instrument-specific co-terminal ATM Swaptions,
  i.e. chosen to match the instruments first expiry and final maturity.  If {\em CoterminalDealStrike} is chosen, the
  co-terminal swaptions will match the fixed rate of the deal (if the deal has changing fixed rates, the first rate is
  matched). Finally if the ShiftHorizon parameter is given, its value times the remaining maturity time of the deal is
  chosen as the horizon shift parameter for the LGM model. If not given, this parameter defaults to $0.5$.

\item The second block of engine parameters specifies the Numerical Swaption engine parameters which determine the
  number of standard deviations covered in the probability density integrals (sy and sx), and the number of grid points
  used per standard deviation (ny and nx).
\end{itemize}

To see the configuration options for the alternative CMS engines (Hagan Numerical, LinearTSR) or the Black Ibor coupon
pricer (CapFlooredIborLeg), please refer to the commented parts in {\tt Examples/Input/pricingengine.xml}.

\medskip
This file is relevant in particular for structured products which are on the roadmap of future ORE releases. But it is also
intended to allow the selection of optimised pricing engines for vanilla products such as Interest Rate Swaps.

\medskip
In addition to product specific settings there is also a block with global parameters with the following meaning:
\begin{itemize}
\item ContinueOnCalibrationError: If set to true an exceedence of a prescribed model calibration tolerance (for e.g. the
  LGM model) will not cause the trade building to fail, instead a warning is logged and the trade is processed
  anyway. Optional, defaults to false.
\item Calibrate: If false, model calibration is disabled. This flag is usually not present in a user configuration, but
  only used internally for certain workflows within ORE which do not require a model calibration. Optional, defaults to
  true.
\item GenerateAdditionalResults: If false, the generation of additional results within pricing engines will be
  suppressed (for those pricing engines which support this). This flag is usually not present in a user configuration,
  but only used internally to improve the performance for processes which only rely on the NPV as a result from pricing
  engines, e.g. when repricing trades under sensitivity or stress scenarios. Option, defaults to false.
\item RunType: Set automatically. One of NPV, SensitivityDelta, SensitivityDeltaGamma, Stress, Exposure, Capital,
  TradeDetails, PortfolioAnalyser, HistoricalPnL, depending on the context for which a portfolio was built. Might also
  be left empty. This is used by some pricing engines to adapt to certain run types. E.g. a first order sensitivity pnl
  expansion might be used for a SensitivityDelta run by an engine which is able to compute analytical or AAD first order
  sensitivities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulation: {\tt simulation.xml}}\label{sec:simulation}
%--------------------------------------------------------

This file determines the behaviour of the risk factor simulation (scenario generation) module.
It is structured in three blocks of data.

\caption{Simulation configuration}
\label{lst:simulation_configuration}
\end{listing}

Each of the three blocks is sketched in the following.

\subsubsection{Parameters}\label{sec:sim_params}

Let us discuss this section using the following example

\begin{listing}[H]
%\hrule\medskip
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<Parameters>
  <Grid>80,3M</Grid>
  <Calendar>EUR,USD,GBP,CHF</Calendar>
  <DayCounter>ACT/ACT</DayCounter>

  <!-- The following two nodes are optional -->
  <CloseOutLag>2W</CloseOutLag>
  <MporMode>StickyDate</MporMode>
</Parameters>
\end{minted}
\caption{Simulation configuration}
\label{lst:simulation_params_configuration}
\end{listing}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt Grid:} Specifies the simulation time grid, here 80 quarterly steps.\footnote{For exposure calculation under DIM, the second parameter has to match the Margin Period of Risk, i.e. if {\tt MarginPeriodOfRisk} is set to for instance {\tt 2W} in a netting set definition in {\tt netting.xml}, then one has to set {\tt Grid} to for instance {\tt 80,2W}.}
\item {\tt Calendar:} Calendar or combination of calendars used to adjust the dates of the grid. Date adjustment is
required because the simulation must step over 'good' dates on which index fixings can be stored.
%\item {\tt Scenario: } Choose between {\em Simple } and {\em Complex } implementations, the latter optimized for
% more efficient memory usage. \todo[inline]{Remove Scenario choice}
\item {\tt DayCounter:} Day count convention used to translate dates to times. Optional, defaults to ActualActual ISDA.
\item {\tt Sequence:} Choose random sequence generator ({\em MersenneTwister, MersenneTwisterAntithetic, Sobol,
SobolBrownianBridge}).
\item {\tt Seed:} Random number generator seed
\item {\tt Samples:} Number of Monte Carlo paths to be produced
%\item {\tt Fixings: } Choose whether fixings should be simulated or not, and if so which fixing simulation method to
use ({\em Backward, Forward, BestOfForwardBackward, InterpolatedForwardBackward}), which number of forward horizon days
to use if one of the {\em Forward } related methods is chosen.
\item {\tt Ordering:} If the sequence type {\em SobolBrownianBridge} is used, ordering of variates ({\em Factors, Steps,
    Diagonal})
\item {\tt DirectionIntegers:} If the sequence type {\em SobolBrownianBridge} or {\em Sobol} is used, type of direction
  integers in Sobol generator ({\em Unit, Jaeckel, SobolLevitan, SobolLevitanLemieux, JoeKuoD5, JoeKuoD6, JoeKuoD7, Kuo,
    Kuo2, Kuo3})
\item {\tt CloseOutLag}: If this tag is present, this specifies the close-out period length (e.g. 2W) used; otherwise no close-out grid is built. The close-out grid is an auxiliary time grid that is offset from the main default date grid by the close-out period, typically set to the applicable margin period of risk. If present, it is used to evolve the portfolio value and determine close-out values associated with the preceding default date valuation.
\item {\tt MporMode}: This tag is expected if the previous one is present, permissible values are then {\tt StickyDate} and {\tt ActualDate}. {\tt StickyDate} means that only market data is evolved from the default date to close-out date for close-out date valuation, the valuation as of date remains unchanged and trades do not ``age'' over the period. As a consequence, exposure evolutions will not show spikes caused by cash flows within the close-out period. {\tt ActualDate} means that trades will also age over the close-out period so that one can experience exposure evolution spikes due to cash flows. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model}\label{sec:sim_model}

The {\tt CrossAssetModel} section determines the cross asset model's number of currencies covered, composition, and each
component's calibration. It is currently made of 
\begin{itemize}
\item a sequence of LGM models for each currency (say $n_c$ currencies), 
\item $n_c-1$ FX models for each exchange rate to the base currency, 
\item $n_e$ equity models,
\item $n_i$ inflation models, 
\item $n_{cr}$ credit models, 
\item $n_{com}$ commodity models, 
\item a specification of the correlation structure between all components.
\end{itemize}

\medskip The simulated currencies are specified as follows, with clearly identifying the domestic currency which is also
the target currency for all FX models listed subsequently. If the portfolio requires more currencies to be simulated,
this will lead to an exception at run time, so that it is the user's responsibility to make sure that the list of
currencies here is sufficient. The list can be larger than actually required by the portfolio. This will not lead to any
exceptions, but add to the run time of ORE.

\begin{listing}[H]

\end{listing}
 
Bootstrap tolerance is a global parameter that applies to the calibration of all model components. If the calibration
error of any component exceeds this tolerance, this will trigger an exception at runtime, early in the ORE process.

The Measure tag allows switching between the LGM and the Bank Account (BA) measure for the risk-neutral market simulations using the Cross Asset Model. Note that within LGM one can shift the horizon (see ParameterTransformation below) to effectively switch to a T-Forward measure.

The Discretization tag chooses between time discretization schemes for the risk factor evolution. {\em Exact} means
exploiting the analytical tractability of the model to avoid any time discretization error. {\em Euler} uses a naive
time discretization scheme which has numerical error and requires small time steps for accurate results (useful for
testing purposes or if more sophisticated component models are used.)

\caption{Simulation model IR configuration}
\label{lst:simulation_model_ir_configuration}
\end{listing}

We have LGM sections by currency, but starting with a section for currency 'default'. As the name implies, this is used
as default configuration for any currency in the currency list for which we do not provide an explicit
parametrisation. Within each LGM section, the interpretation of elements is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt CalibrationType: } Choose between {\em Bootstrap} and {\em BestFit}, where Bootstrap is chosen when we expect
to be able to achieve a perfect fit (as with calibration of piecewise volatility to a series of co-terminal Swaptions)
\item {\tt Volatility/Calibrate: } Flag to enable/disable calibration of this particular parameter
\item {\tt Volatility/VolatilityType: } Choose volatility parametrisation a la {\em HullWhite} or {\em Hagan}
\item {\tt Volatility/ParamType: } Choose between {\em Constant} and {\em Piecewise}
\item {\tt Volatility/TimeGrid: } Initial time grid for this parameter, can be left empty if ParamType is Constant
\item {\tt Volatility/InitialValue: } Vector of initial values, matching number of entries in time (for CalibrationType {\em BestFit} this should be one more entry than the {\tt Volatility/TimeGrid} entries, for {\em Bootstrap} this is ignored), or single value if the time grid is empty
\item {\tt Reversion/Calibrate: } Flag to enable/disable calibration of this particular parameter
\item {\tt Reversion/VolatilityType: } Choose reversion parametrisation a la {\em HullWhite} or {\em Hagan}
\item {\tt Reversion/ParamType: } Choose between {\em Constant} and {\em Piecewise}
\item {\tt Reversion/TimeGrid: } Initial time grid for this parameter, can be left empty if ParamType is Constant
\item {\tt Reversion/InitialValue: } Vector of initial values, matching number of entries in time, or single value if
the time grid is empty
\item {\tt CalibrationSwaptions: } Choice of calibration instruments by expiry, underlying Swap term and strike. There have to be at least one more calibration options configured than {\tt Volatility/TimeGrid} entries were given.
\item {\tt ParameterTransformation: } LGM model prices are invariant under scaling and shift transformations
\cite{Lichters} with advantages for numerical convergence of results in long term simulations. These transformations can
be chosen here. Default settings are shiftHorizon 0 (time in years) and scaling factor 1.
\end{itemize}

The reason for having to specify one more {\tt Volatility/InitialValue} entries than {\tt Volatility/TimeGrid} entries (and at least one more calibration option than {\tt Volatility/TimeGrid} entries) is the fact that the intervals defined by the {\tt Volatility/TimeGrid} entries are spanning from $[0,t_1],[t_1,t_2]\ldots[t_n,\infty]$, which results in $n+1$ intervals.

CrossCcyLGM sections are defined by foreign currency, but we also support a default configuration as above for the IR
model parametrisations.  Within each CrossCcyLGM section, the interpretation of elements is as follows:

such as $\pm 25D$, $ATMF$ for at the money). There have to be at least one more calibration options configured than {\tt Sigma/TimeGrid} entries were given

For the inflation model component, there is a choice between a Dodgson Kainth model and a Jarrow Yildrim model. The Dodgson Kainth 
model is specified in a \lstinline!LGM! or \lstinline!DodgsonKainth! node as outlined in Listing \ref{lst:simulation_model_dk_inflation_configuration}.
The inflation model parameterisation inherits from the LGM parameterisation for interest rate components, in particular the \lstinline!CalibrationType!, 
\lstinline!Volatility! and \lstinline!Reversion! elements. The \lstinline!CalibrationCapFloors! element specify the model's calibration to a selection of 
either CPI caps or CPI floors with specified strike.

The calibration instruments may be specified in an alternative way via a \lstinline!CalibrationBaskets! node. In general, a \lstinline!CalibrationBaskets! node 
can contain multiple \lstinline!CalibrationBasket! nodes each containing a list of calibration instruments of the same type. For Dodgson Kainth, only a single 
calibration basket is allowed and the instruments must be of type \lstinline!CpiCapFloor!. So, for example, the \lstinline!CalibrationCapFloors! node in 
Listing \ref{lst:simulation_model_dk_inflation_configuration} could be replaced with the \lstinline!CalibrationBaskets! node in \ref{lst:dk_inflation_calibration_basket}.

\caption{Calibration basket for DK inflation model component}
\label{lst:dk_inflation_calibration_basket}
\end{listing}

The Jarrow Yildrim model is specified in a \lstinline!JarrowYildirim! node as outlined in Listing \ref{lst:simulation_model_jy_inflation_configuration}. The \lstinline!RealRate! 
node describes the JY real rate process and has \lstinline!Volatility! and \lstinline!Reversion! nodes that follow those outlined in the interest rate LGM section above. The  
\lstinline!Index! node describes the JY index process and has a \lstinline!Volatility! component that follows the \lstinline!Sigma! component of the FX model above. The 
\lstinline!CalibrationBaskets! node is as outlined above for Dodgson Kainth but up to two baskets may be used and extra inflation instruments are supported in the calibration. More 
information is provided below.

The \lstinline!CalibrationType! determines the calibration approach, if any, that is used to calibrate the various parameters of the model i.e.\ the real rate reversion, the real 
rate volatility and the index volatility. If the \lstinline!CalibrationType! is \lstinline!None!, no calibration is attempted and all parameter values must be explicitly specified.
If the \lstinline!CalibrationType! is \lstinline!BestFit!, the parameters that have \lstinline!Calibrate! set to \lstinline!Y! will be calibrated to the instruments specified in 
the \lstinline!CalibrationBaskets! node. If the \lstinline!CalibrationType! is \lstinline!Bootstrap!, there are a number of options:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The index volatility parameter may be calibrated, indicated by setting \lstinline!Calibrate! to \lstinline!Y! for that parameter, with both of the real rate parameters not calibrated 
and set explicitly in the \lstinline!RealRate! node. There should be exactly one \lstinline!CalibrationBasket! in the \lstinline!CalibrationBaskets! node and its \lstinline!parameter! 
attribute may be set to \lstinline!Index! or omitted.

\item
One of the real rate parameters may be calibrated, indicated by setting \lstinline!Calibrate! to \lstinline!Y! for that parameter, with the index volatility not calibrated and set 
explicitly in the \lstinline!Volatility! node. There should be exactly one \lstinline!CalibrationBasket! in the \lstinline!CalibrationBaskets! node and its \lstinline!parameter! 
attribute may be set to \lstinline!RealRate! or omitted.

\item
One of the real rate parameters and the index volatility parameter may be calibrated together. There should be exactly two \lstinline!CalibrationBasket! nodes in the \lstinline!CalibrationBaskets! 
node. The \lstinline!parameter! attribute should be set to \lstinline!RealRate! on the \lstinline!CalibrationBasket! node that should be used for the real rate parameter calibration. 
Similarly, the \lstinline!parameter! attribute should be set to \lstinline!Index! on the \lstinline!CalibrationBasket! node that should be used for the index volatility parameter calibration. 
The parameters are calibrated iteratively in turn until the root mean squared error over all calibration instruments in the two baskets is below the tolerance specified by the 
\lstinline!RmseTolerance! in the \lstinline!CalibrationConfiguration! node or until the maximum number of iterations as specified by the \lstinline!MaxIterations! in the 
\lstinline!CalibrationConfiguration! node has been reached. The \lstinline!CalibrationConfiguration! node is optional. If it is omitted, the \lstinline!RmseTolerance! defaults to 0.0001 and the 
\lstinline!MaxIterations! defaults to 50.

\end{enumerate}

Note that it is an error to attempt to calibrate both of the real rate parameters together when \lstinline!CalibrationType! is \lstinline!Bootstrap!. If a parameter is being calibrated 
with \lstinline!CalibrationType! set to \lstinline!Bootstrap!, the \lstinline!ParamType! should be \lstinline!Piecewise!. The \lstinline!TimeGrid! will be overridden for that parameter by 
the relevant calibration instrument times and the parameter's initial values are set to the first element of the \lstinline!InitialValue! list. So, leaving the \lstinline!TimeGrid! node 
empty and giving a single value in the \lstinline!InitialValue! node is the clearest XML setup in this case.

For commodity simulation we currently provide one model, as described in the methodology appendix. 
Commodity model components are specified by commodity name, by a block as follows

\label{lst:simulation_model_com_configuration}
\end{listing}

CommoditySchwartz sections are defined by commodity name, but we also support a default configuration as above for the IR and 
FX model parameterisations.  Each component is parameterised in terms of two constant, non time-dependent parameters $\sigma$ and $\kappa$ so far (see appendix).
Within each CommoditySchwartz section, the interpretation of elements is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt Currency: } Currency of denomination
\item {\tt CalibrationType:} Choose between {\em BestFit} and {\em None}.  The choice {\em None} will deactivate calibration as usual. {\em BestFit} will attempt to set the model parameter(s) such that the error in matching calibration instrument prices is minimised.  The option  {\em Bootstrap} is not available here because the model parameters are not time-dependent and the model's degrees of freedom in general do not suffice to perfectly match the calibration instrument prices.
\item {\tt Sigma/Calibrate:} Flag to enable/disable calibration of this particular parameter
\item {\tt Sigma/InitialValue:} Initial value of the constant parameter
\item {\tt Kappa/Calibrate:} Flag to enable/disable calibration of this particular parameter
\item {\tt Kappa/InitialValue:} Initial value of the constant parameter
\item {\tt CalibrationOptions:} Choice of calibration instruments by expiry and strike, strikes can be empty 	(implying the default, ATMF options), or explicitly specified (in terms of commodity prices as absolute strike values). 
\item {\tt DriftFreeState[Optional]:} Boolean to switch between the two implementations of the state variable, see appendix. By default this is set to {\tt false}.        
\end{itemize}

\medskip
Finally, the instantaneous correlation structure is specified as follows.

\begin{listing}[H]

Any risk factor pair not specified explicitly here will be assumed to have zero correlation. Note that the commodity components can have non-zero correlations among each other, but correlations to all other CAM components must remain set to zero for the time being.

\subsubsection{Market}\label{sec:sim_market}

The last part of the simulation configuration file covers the specification of the simulated market.  Note that the
simulation model will yield the evolution of risk factors such as short rates which need to be translated into entire
yield curves that can be 'understood' by the instruments which we want to price under scenarios.  

Moreover we need to specify how volatility structures evolve even if we do not explicitly simulate volatility. This 
translation happens based on the information in the {\em simulation market} object, which is configured in the section 
within the enclosing tags {\tt <Market>} and {\tt </Market>}, as shown in the following small example.

It should be noted that equity volatilities are taken to be a curve by default. To simulate an equity volatility surface with smile the xml node {\tt <Surface> } must be supplied.
There are two methods in ORE for equity volatility simulation: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Simulating ATM volatilities only (and shifting other strikes relative to this using the $T_{0}$ smile). In this case set {\tt <SimulateATMOnly>} to true.
\item Simulating the full volatility surface. The node {\tt <SimulateATMOnly>} should be omitted or set to false, and explicit moneyness levels for simulation should be provided.
\end{itemize}

Swaption volatilities are taken to be a surface by default. To simulate a swaption volatility cube with smile the xml node {\tt <Cube> } must be supplied.
There are two methods in ORE for swaption volatility cube simulation: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Simulating ATM volatilities only (and shifting other strikes relative to this using the $T_{0}$ smile). In this case set {\tt <SimulateATMOnly>} to true.
\item Simulating the full volatility cube. The node {\tt <SimulateATMOnly>} should be omitted or set to false, and explicit strike spreads for simulation should be provided.
\end{itemize}

FX volatilities are taken to be a curve by default. To simulate an FX volatility cube with smile the xml node {\tt <Surface> } must be supplied. The surface node contains the moneyness levels to be simulated.

For Yield Curves, Swaption Volatilities, CapFloor Volatilities, Default Curves, Base Correlations and Inflation Curves, a DayCounter may be specified for each risk factor using the node {\tt <DayCounter name="EXAMPLE\_CURVE">}.  
If no day counter is specified for a given risk factor then the default Actual365 is used. To specify a new default for a risk factor type then use the daycounter node without any attribute,  {\tt <DayCounter>}.

For Yield Curves, there are several choices for the interpolation and extrapolation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Interpolation: This can be LogLinear or LinearZero. If not given, the value defaults to LogLinear.
\item Extrapolation: This can be FlatFwd or FlatZero. If not given, the value defaults to FlatFwd.
\end{itemize}

For Default Curve, there is a similar choice for the extrapolation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Extrapolation: This can be FlatFwd or FlatZero. If not given, the value defaults to FlatFwd.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis: {\tt sensitivity.xml}}\label{sec:sensitivity}
%--------------------------------------------------------

ORE currently supports sensitivity analysis with respect to
\begin{itemize}
\item Discount curves  (in the zero rate domain)
\item Index curves (in the zero rate domain)
\item Yield curves including e.g. equity forecast yield curves (in the zero rate domain)
\item FX Spots
\item FX volatilities
\item Swaption volatilities, ATM matrix or cube 
\item Cap/Floor volatility matrices (in the caplet/floorlet domain)
\item Default probability curves (in the ``zero rate'' domain, expressing survival probabilities $S(t)$ in term of zero rates $z(t)$ via $S(t)=\exp(-z(t)\times t)$ with Actual/365 day counter)
\item Equity spot prices
\item Equity volatilities, ATM or including strike dimension 
\item Zero inflation curves
\item Year-on-Year inflation curves
\item CDS volatilities
\item Bond credit spreads
\item Base correlation curves
\item Correlation termstructures
\end{itemize}

The {\tt sensitivity.xml} file specifies how sensitivities are computed for each market component. 
The general structure is shown in listing \ref{lst:sensitivity_config}, for a more comprehensive case see {\tt Examples/Example\_15}. A subset of the following parameters is used in each market component to specify the sensitivity analysis:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ShiftType:} Both absolute or relative shifts can be used to compute a sensitivity, specified by the key words
  {\tt Absolute} resp. {\tt Relative}.
\item {\tt ShiftSize:} The size of the shift to apply.
\item {\tt ShiftTenors:} For curves, the tenor buckets to apply shifts to, given as a comma separated list of periods.
\item {\tt ShiftExpiries:} For volatility surfaces, the option expiry buckets to apply shifts to, given as a comma
  separated list of periods.
\item {\tt ShiftStrikes:} For cap/floor, FX option and equity option volatility surfaces, the strikes to apply shifts to, given as a comma separated
  list of absolute strikes
\item {\tt ShiftTerms:} For swaption volatility surfaces, the underlying terms to apply shifts to, given as a comma
  separated list of periods.
\item {\tt Index:} For cap / floor volatility surfaces, the index which together with the currency defines the surface.
  list of absolute strikes
\item {\tt CurveType:} In the context of Yield Curves used to identify an equity ``risk free'' rate forecasting curve; set to {\tt EquityForecast} in this case
\end{itemize}

The cross gamma filter section contains a list of pairs of sensitivity keys. For each possible pair of sensitivity keys
matching the given strings, a cross gamma sensitivity is computed. The given pair of keys can be (and usually are)
shorter than the actual sensitivity keys. In this case only the prefix of the actual key is matched. For example, the
pair {\tt DiscountCurve/EUR,DiscountCurve/EUR} matches all actual sensitivity pairs belonging to a cross sensitivity by
one pillar of the EUR discount curve and another (different) pillar of the same curve. We list the possible keys by
giving an example in each category:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt DiscountCurve/EUR/5/7Y}: 7y pillar of discounting curve in EUR, the pillar is at position 5 in the list of
  all pillars (counting starts with zero)
\item {\tt YieldCurve/BENCHMARK\_EUR/0/6M}: 6M pillar of yield curve ``BENCHMARK\_EUR'', the index of the 6M pillar is
  zero (i.e. it is the first pillar)
\item {\tt IndexCurve/EUR-EURIBOR-6M/2/2Y}: 2Y pillar of index forwarding curve for the Ibor index ``EUR-EURIBOR-6M'',
  the pillar index is 2 in this case
\item {\tt OptionletVolatility/EUR/18/5Y/0.04}: EUR caplet volatility surface, at 5Y option expiry and $4\%$ strike, the
  running index for this expiry - strike pair is 18; the index counts the points in the surface in lexical order
  w.r.t. the dimensions option expiry, strike
\item {\tt FXSpot/USDEUR/0/spot}: FX spot USD vs EUR (with EUR as base ccy), the index is always zero for FX spots, the
  pillar is labelled as ``spot'' always
\item {\tt SwaptionVolatility/EUR/11/10Y/10Y/ATM}: EUR Swaption volatility surface at 10Y option expiry and 10Y
  underlying term, ATM level, the running index for this expiry, term, strike triple has running index 11; the index
  counts the points in the surface in lexical order w.r.t. the dimensions option expiry, underlying term and strike
\end{itemize}

Additional flags:

\begin{itemize}
\item ComputeGamma: If set to false, second order sensitivity computation is suppressed
\item UseSpreadedTermStructures: If set to true, spreaded termstructures over t0 will be used for sensitivity
  calculation (where supported), to improve the alignment of the scenario sim market and t0 curves

\subsection{Stress Scenario Analysis: {\tt stressconfig.xml}}\label{sec:stress}

Stress tests can be applied in ORE to the same market segments and with same granularity as described in the sensitivity section \ref{sec:sensitivity}.

\medskip
This file {\tt stressconfig.xml} specifies how stress tests can be configured. The general structure is shown in listing
\ref{lst:stress_config}.

In this example, two stress scenarios ``parallel\_rates'' and ``twist'' are defined. Each scenario definition contains
the market components to be shifted in this scenario in a similar syntax that is also used for the sensitivity
configuration, see \ref{sec:sensitivity}. Components that should not be shifted, can just be omitted in the definition
of the scenario.

However, instead of specifying one shift size per market component, here a whole vector of shifts can be given, with
different shift sizes applied to each point of the curve (or surface / cube).

In case of the swaption volatility shifts, the single value given as {\tt Shift} (without the attributes {\tt expiry}
and {\tt term}) represents a default value that is used whenever no explicit value is given for a expiry / term pair.

 This file {\tt calendaradjustment.xml} list out all additional holidays and business days that are added to a specified calendar in ORE.
 These dates would originally be missing from the calendar and has to be added.The general structure is shown in listing \ref{lst:calendar_adjustment}.
In this example, two additional dates had been added to the calendar "Japan", one additional holiday and one additional business day. If the user is not certain
wether the date is already included or not, adding it to the {\tt calendaradjustment.xml} to be safe won't raise any errors.
A sample {\tt calendaradjustment.xml} file can be found in the global example input directory. However, it is only used in Example\_1.

The equity curves here consists of a spot equity price, as well as a set of either forward prices or else dividend 
yields. If the index is a dividend futures index then curve type should be entered as ForwardDividendPrice. In this case the curve will be built from forward prices as normal, but excluded from the SIMM calculations as required by the SIMM methodology.
Upon construction, ORE stores internally an equity spot price quote, a forecasting curve and a dividend yield 
term structure, which are then used together for projection of forward prices.

\subsubsection{Equity Volatility Structures}

When configuring volatility structures for equities, there are four options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a constant volatility for all expiries and strikes.
\item a volatility curve with a dependency on expiry but no strike dimension.
\item a volatility surface with an expiry and strike dimension.
\item a proxy surface - point to another surface as a proxy.
\end{enumerate}

There are a number of fields common to all configurations:
\begin{itemize}
\item CurveId: Unique identifier for the curve.
\item CurveDescription: A description of the curve. This field may be left blank.
\item Currency: Currency of the equity.
\item Calendar [Optional]: allowable value is any valid calendar. Defaults to \lstinline!NullCalendar!.
\item DayCounter [Optional]: allowable value is any valid day counter. Defaults to \lstinline!A365!.
\item OneDimSolverConfig [Optional]: A configuration for the one dimensional solver used in deriving volatilities from prices. This node is described in detail in Section \ref{sec:one_dim_solver_config}. If not provided, a default step based configuration is used. This is only used when volatilities are stripped from prices.
\item PreferOutOfTheMoney [Optional]: allowable value is any boolean value. Defaults to \lstinline!false! for backwards compatibility. It is used, when building the volatility surface, to choose between a call and put option price or volatility when both are provided. When set to \lstinline!true!, the out of the money option is chosen by comparing the quote's strike with the forward price at the associated expiry. Conversely, when set to \lstinline!false!, the in the money option is chosen.
\end{itemize}

Listing \ref{lst:eqoptionvol_constant} shows the configuration of equity volatility structures with constant volatility. A node \lstinline!Constant! takes one \lstinline!Quote!, as described in Section \ref{md:equity_option_iv}, which is held constant for all strikes and expiries.

Secondly, the volatility curve configuration layout is given in Listing \ref{lst:eqoptionvol_curve}. With this curve construction the volatility is held constant in the strike direction, and quotes of varying expiry can be provided, for examlple if only ATM volatility quotes are available. The volatility quote IDs in the \lstinline!Quotes! node should be Equity option volatility quotes as described in Section \ref{md:equity_option_iv}. An explicit list of quotes can be provided, or a single quote with a wildcard replacing the expiry/strike. In the wildcard case, it will look for any matching quotes provided in the loader, and construct the curve from these. The \lstinline!Interpolation! node supports \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!Cubic! and \lstinline!LogLinear! interpolation. The \lstinline!Extrapolation! node supports either \lstinline!None! for no extrapolation or \lstinline!Flat! for flat extrapolation in the volatility.

\lstinline!QuoteType!: either \lstinline!ImpliedVolatility! of \lstinline!Premium!, indicating the type of quotes provided in the market.

\item
\lstinline!ExerciseType! [Optional]: only valid when \lstinline!QuoteType! is \lstinline!Premium!. Valid types are \lstinline!European! and \lstinline!American!.

\item
\lstinline!VolatilityType! [Optional]: only valid when \lstinline!QuoteType! is \lstinline!ImpliedVolatility!. Valid types are \lstinline!Lognormal!, \lstinline!ShiftedLognormal! and \lstinline!Normal!.

\item
\lstinline!Strikes!: comma separated list of strikes, representing the absolute strike values for the option. In other words, A single wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, can be used here also to indicate that all strikes found in the market data for this equity volatility configuration should be used when building the equity volatility surface.

\item
\lstinline!Expiries!: comma separated list of expiry tenors and or expiry dates. A single wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, can be used here also to indicate that all expiries found in the market data for this equity volatility configuration should be used when building the equity volatility surface.

\item
\lstinline!TimeInterpolation!: interpolation in the option expiry direction. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear! is used. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!Cubic! is allowed here but the value must agree with the value for \lstinline!StrikeInterpolation!.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeInterpolation!: interpolation in the strike direction. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear! is used. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!Cubic! is allowed here but the value must agree with the value for \lstinline!TimeInterpolation!.

\item
\lstinline!Extrapolation!: boolean value. If \lstinline!true!, extrapolation is allowed. If \lstinline!false!, extrapolation is not allowed.

\item
\lstinline!TimeExtrapolation!: extrapolation in the option expiry direction. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, the extrapolation in the time direction is flat in volatility regardless of the setting here. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!UseInterpolator!, \lstinline!Flat! or \lstinline!None! are allowed. If \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!UseInterpolator! is specified, the extrapolation is linear. If \lstinline!Flat! is specified, the extrapolation is flat. If \lstinline!None! is specified, it is ignored and the extrapolation is flat since extrapolation in the time direction cannot be turned off in isolation i.e.\ extrapolation can only be turned off for the surface as a whole using the \lstinline!Extrapolation! flag.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeExtrapolation!: extrapolation in the strike direction. The allowable values are \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!UseInterpolator!, \lstinline!Flat! or \lstinline!None!. If \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!UseInterpolator! is specified, the extrapolation uses the strike interpolation setting for extrapolation i.e. linear or cubic in this case. If \lstinline!Flat! is specified, the extrapolation is flat. If \lstinline!None! is specified, it is ignored and the extrapolation is flat since extrapolation in the strike direction cannot be turned off in isolation i.e.\ extrapolation can only be turned off for the surface as a whole using the \lstinline!Extrapolation! flag.

\end{itemize}

When this configuration is used, the market is searched for quote strings of the form \lstinline!EQUITY_OPTION/PRICE/[NAME]/[CURRENCY]/[EXPIRY]/[STRIKE]! or \lstinline!EQUITY_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[CURRENCY]/[EXPIRY]/[STRIKE]!, depending on the \lstinline!QuoteType!. When both the \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, it is clear that the \lstinline![EXPIRY]! field is populated from the list of expiries in turn and the \lstinline![STRIKE]! field is populated from the list of strikes in turn. If there are $m$ expiries in the \lstinline!Expiries! list and $n$ strikes in the \lstinline!Strikes! list, there will be $m \times n$ quotes created and searched for in the market data. If \lstinline!Expiries! are configured via the wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, all quotes in the market data matching the pattern \lstinline!EQUITY_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[CURRENCY]/*/[STRIKE]!. Similarly for \lstinline!Strikes! configured via the wildcard character, \lstinline!*!.

A volatility surface can also be given in terms of moneyness levels as shown in listing
\ref{lst:eqoptionvol_mny_surface}. The nodes have the same meaning as in the case of a strike surface with the following
exceptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline!QuoteType!: only \lstinline!ImpliedVolatility! is allowed
\item \lstinline!VolatilityType! [Optional]: only \lstinline!Lognormal! is allowed
\item \lstinline!MoneynessType!: \lstinline!Spot! or \lstinline!Fwd!, indicating the type of moneyness. See

\item \lstinline!MoneynessLevels!: comma separated list of moneyness levels, no wild cards are allowed.
\item \lstinline!Expiries!: comma separated list of expiry tenors and or expiry dates.

\end{itemize}

Notice that the market data for the moneyness level $1.0$ must be given as a moneyness quote, not an ATM or ATMF quote,
see \ref{md:equity_option_iv} for details of the market data.

Finally, the volatility proxy surface configuration layout is given in Listing \ref{lst:eqoptionvol_proxy}. This allows us to use any other surface as a proxy, in cases where there is no option data for a given equity. We provide a name in the \lstinline!EquityVolatilityCurve! field, which must match the \lstinline!CurveId! of another configuration.  \lstinline!FXVolatilityCurve! and \lstinline!CorrelationCurve! must be provided if the currency of the proxy surface is different to that of current surface, that can be omitted otherwise. The proxy surface looks up the volatility in the reference surface based on moneyness.

\caption{Inflation Curve Configuration}
\label{lst:inflationcurve_configuration}
\end{longlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt NominalTermStructure}: The interest rate curve to be used to strip the inflation curve.
\item {\tt Type}: The type of the curve, {\tt ZC} for zero coupon, {\tt YY} for year on year.
\item {\tt Quotes}: The instruments' market quotes from which to bootstrap the curve.
\item {\tt Conventions}: The conventions applicable to the curve instruments.
\item {\tt Lag}: The observation lag used in the term structure.
\item {\tt Frequency}: The frequency of index fixings.
\item {\tt BaseRate}: The rate at $t=0$, this introduces an additional degree of freedom to get a smoother curve. If not
  given, it is defaulted to the first market rate.
\end{itemize}

The optional seasonality block defines a multiplicative seasonality and contains the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt BaseDate}: Defines the first inflation period to which to apply the seasonality correction, only day and
  month matters, the year is ignored.
\item {\tt Frequency:} Defines the frequency of the factors (usually identical to the index's fixing frequency).
\item {\tt Factors:} Multiplicative seasonality correction factors, must be part of the market data.
\item {\tt OverrideFactors:} A numeric list of seasonality correction factors, replacing the Factors. This allows to
  specify a static seasonality correction that does not require market data quotes. If both Factors and OverrideFactors
  are given, the OverrideFactors are used. Otherwise only one of Factors, OverrideFactors is required in a seasonality
  block.
\end{itemize}

We note that if zero coupon swap market quotes are given, but the type is set to YY, the zero coupon swap quotes will be
converted to year on year swap quotes on the fly, using the plain forward rates, i.e. no convexity adjustment is
applied.

\caption{Inflation ZC cap floor volatility surface configuration}
\label{lst:inflationcapfloorvolsurface_configuration}
\end{longlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt Type}: The type of the surface, {\tt ZC} for zero coupon, {\tt YY} for year on year. 
\item {\tt QuoteType}: The type of the quotes used to build the surface, {\tt Volatility} for volatility quotes, {\tt Price} for bootstrap from option premia. 
\item {\tt VolatilityType}: If QuoteType is {\tt Volatility}, this specifies whether the input is {\tt Normal}, {\tt Lognormal} or {\tt ShiftedLognormal}. 
\item {\tt Extrapolation}: Boolean to indicate whether the surface should allow extrapolation. 
\item {\tt DayCounter}: The term structure's day counter
\item {\tt Calendar}: The term structure's calendar 
\item {\tt BusinessDayConvention}: The term structure's business day convention
\item {\tt Tenors:} The maturities for which cap and floor prices are quoted
\item {\tt Strikes}: In the case of QuoteType {\tt Volatility}, the strikes for which floor prices are quoted (may, and will usually, overlap with the cap
  strike region); neither CapStrikes nor FloorStrikes are expected in this case. 
\item {\tt CapStrikes}: The strikes for which cap prices are quoted (may, and will usually, overlap with the floor
  strike region); if the QuoteType above is {\tt Price}, either CapStrikes or FloorStrikes or both are required.
\item {\tt FloorStrikes}: The strikes for which floor prices are quoted (may and will usually) overlap with the cap
  strike region); if the QuoteType above is {\tt Price}, either CapStrikes or FloorStrikes or both are required. 
\item {\tt Index}: The underlying zero inflation index.
\item {\tt IndexCurve}: The curve id of the index's projection curve used to determine the ATM levels for the surface.
\item {\tt IndexInterpolated}: Flag indicating whether the index should be interpolating.
\item {\tt Observation Lag}: The observation lag applicable to the term structure.
\item {\tt YieldTermStructure}: The nominal term structure.
\item \lstinline!QuoteIndex!: An optional node allowing the user to provide an alternative index name for forming the quotes that will be used in building the cap floor surface. If this node is not provided, the \lstinline!Index! node value is used in quote construction. For example, quotes must be created from each strike and each tenor and these quotes are subsequently looked up in the market data when building the cap floor volatility surface. The quotes are formed by concatenating \lstinline![Type]_INFLATIONCAPFLOOR!, \lstinline!PRICE! or \lstinline!RATE_[Vol_Type]VOL!, \lstinline![Index_Name]!, \lstinline![Tenor]!, \lstinline!C! or \lstinline!F! and \lstinline![Strike]! delimited by \lstinline!/!. If \lstinline!QuoteIndex! is provided, it is used as the \lstinline![Index_Name]! token. If it is not provided \lstinline!Index! is used as usual.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{CDS Volatilities}

When configuring volatility structures for CDS and index CDS options, there are three options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a constant volatility for all expiries, strikes and terms.
\item a volatility curve with a dependency on expiry and term, but no strike dimension.
\item a volatility surface with an expiry, term and strike dimension.
\end{enumerate}

Firstly, the constant volatility configuration layout is given in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_constant_config}. The single volatility quote ID, \lstinline!constant_quote_id!, in the \lstinline!Quote! node should be a CDS option volatility quote as described in Section \ref{md:cds_option_iv}. The \lstinline!DayCounter! node is optional and defaults to \lstinline!A365F!. The \lstinline!Calendar! node is optional and defaults to \lstinline!NullCalendar!. The \lstinline!DayCounter! and \lstinline!Calendar! nodes are common to all three CDS volatility configurations.

\begin{longlisting}

  <Calendar>...</Calendar>
</CDSVolatility>
\end{minted}
\caption{Constant CDS volatility configuration}
\label{lst:cdsvol_constant_config}
\end{longlisting}

Secondly, the volatility curve configuration layout is given in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_curve_config}. The volatility quote IDs, \lstinline!quote_id_1!, \lstinline!quote_id_2!, etc., in the \lstinline!Quotes! node should be CDS option volatility quotes as described in Section \ref{md:cds_option_iv}. The \lstinline!Interpolation! node supports \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!Cubic! and \lstinline!LogLinear! interpolation. The \lstinline!Extrapolation! node supports either \lstinline!None! for no extrapolation or \lstinline!Flat! for flat extrapolation in the volatility.

The optional boolean parameter \lstinline!EnforceMontoneVariance! should be set to \lstinline!true! to raise an exception if the curve implied variance is not montone increasing with time and should be set to \lstinline!false! if you want to suppress such an exception. The default value for \lstinline!EnforceMontoneVariance! is \lstinline!true!.

\end{minted}
\caption{CDS volatility curve configuration}
\label{lst:cdsvol_curve_config}
\end{longlisting}

For backwards compatibility, the volatility curve configuration can also be given using a single \lstinline!Expiries! node as shown in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_curve_config_alt}. Note that this configuration is deprecated and the configuration in \ref{lst:cdsvol_curve_config} is preferred. The \lstinline!Expiries! node should take a comma separated list of tenors and or expiry dates e.g.\ \lstinline!<Expiries>1M,3M,6M</Expiries>!. The list of expiries are extracted and a set of quotes are created of the form \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[EXPIRY]! or \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[TERM]/[EXPIRY]!. There is one quote for each expiry in the list where the \lstinline![EXPIRY]! field is understood to be replaced with the expiry string extracted from the list.

The \lstinline![NAME]! field is populated with the curve id or with the \lstinline![QuoteName]! if that is specified. The rules for including market quotes into the volatility surface construction are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item All quotes explicitly specified with their full name are loaded (applies to configs of type constant or curve
  without wildcards)
\item If a quote does not contain a term, we only load it if at most one term is specified in the vol curve config. The
  quote gets the unique term specified in the vol curve configs assigned or 5Y if the config does not specify any terms.
\item If a quote contains a term if this matches one of the configured terms in the curve configuration or if the curve
  configuration does not specify any terms.
\end{itemize}

The \lstinline![Terms]! node specifies a list of term labels ``5Y'', ``7Y'', ... and associated credit curve spec names
representing the curve suitable to estimate the ATM level for that term.

If only one expiry is provided in the list, there is only one quote and a constant volatility structure is configured as in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_constant_config}. If more than one expiry is provided, a curve is configured as in \ref{lst:cdsvol_curve_config}. The interpolation is \lstinline!Linear!, the extrapolation is \lstinline!Flat! and \lstinline!EnforceMontoneVariance! is \lstinline!true!.

\end{longlisting}

Thirdly, the volatility surface configuration layout is given in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_surface_config}. The nodes have the following meanings and supported values:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\lstinline!Strikes!: comma separated list of strikes. The strikes may be in terms of spread or price. However, it is important to ensure that the trade XML for a CDS option or index CDS option provides the strike in the same way. In other words, if the strike is in terms of spread on the trade XML, the strike must be in terms of spread in the CDS volatility configuration here. Similarly for strikes in terms of price. A single wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, can be used here also to indicate that all strikes found in the market data for this CDS volatility configuration should be used when building the CDS volatility surface.

\item
\lstinline!Expiries!: comma separated list of expiry tenors and or expiry dates. A single wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, can be used here also to indicate that all expiries found in the market data for this CDS volatility configuration should be used when building the CDS volatility surface.

\item
\lstinline!TimeInterpolation!: interpolation in the option expiry direction. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear! is used. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!Cubic! is allowed here but the value must agree with the value for \lstinline!StrikeInterpolation!.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeInterpolation!: interpolation in the strike direction. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear! is used. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!Cubic! is allowed here but the value must agree with the value for \lstinline!TimeInterpolation!.

\item
\lstinline!Extrapolation!: boolean value. If \lstinline!true!, extrapolation is allowed. If \lstinline!false!, extrapolation is not allowed.

\item
\lstinline!TimeExtrapolation!: extrapolation in the option expiry direction. If both \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, the extrapolation in the time direction is flat in volatility regardless of the setting here. If either \lstinline!Strikes! or \lstinline!Expiries! are configured with a wildcard character, \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!UseInterpolator!, \lstinline!Flat! or \lstinline!None! are allowed. If \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!UseInterpolator! is specified, the extrapolation is linear. If \lstinline!Flat! is specified, the extrapolation is flat. If \lstinline!None! is specified, it is ignored and the extrapolation is flat since extrapolation in the time direction cannot be turned off in isolation i.e.\ extrapolation can only be turned off for the surface as a whole using the \lstinline!Extrapolation! flag.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeExtrapolation!: extrapolation in the strike direction. The allowable values are \lstinline!Linear!, \lstinline!UseInterpolator!, \lstinline!Flat! or \lstinline!None!. If \lstinline!Linear! or \lstinline!UseInterpolator! is specified, the extrapolation uses the strike interpolation setting for extrapolation i.e. linear or cubic in this case. If \lstinline!Flat! is specified, the extrapolation is flat. If \lstinline!None! is specified, it is ignored and the extrapolation is flat since extrapolation in the strike direction cannot be turned off in isolation i.e.\ extrapolation can only be turned off for the surface as a whole using the \lstinline!Extrapolation! flag.

\item
\lstinline!DayCounter!: allowable value is any valid day count fraction. As stated above, this node is optional and defaults to \lstinline!A365F!.

\item
\lstinline!Calendar!: allowable value is any valid calendar. As stated above, this node is optional and defaults to \lstinline!NullCalendar!.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeType!: allowable value is either \lstinline!Price! or \lstinline!Spread!. This flag denotes if the strikes are in terms of spread or price. Currently, this is merely informational and as outlined in the \lstinline!Strikes! section above, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the strike type in trades aligns with the configured strike type in the CDS volatility surfaces.

\item
\lstinline!QuoteName!: this node is optional and the allowable value is any string. This value can be used in determining the name and term that appears in the quote strings that are searched for in the market data to feed into the CDS volatility surface construction. How it is used has been outlined above when describing the deprecated CDS volatility curve configuration.

\item
\lstinline!StrikeFactor!: this node is optional and the allowable value is any positive real number. It defaults to 1. The strikes configured and found in the market data quote strings may not be in absolute terms. For example, a quote string such as \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/CDXIGS33V1/5Y/1M/115! could be given to indicate an index CDS option volatility quote for CDX IG Series 33 Version 1, with underlying index term 5Y expiring in 1M with a strike spread of 115 bps. The strike here is in bps and needs to be divided by 10,000 before being used in the ORE volatility objects. The \lstinline!StrikeFactor! would be set to \lstinline!10000! here.

\end{itemize}

When the CDS volatility surface is configured as in Listing \ref{lst:cdsvol_surface_config}, the market is searched for quote strings of the form \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[EXPIRY]/[STRIKE]! or \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[TERM]/[EXPIRY]/[STRIKE]!. The population of the \lstinline![NAME]! field, and possibly the \lstinline![TERM]! field, and how they depend on the \lstinline!QuoteName! and \lstinline!ParseTerm! nodes has been discussed at length above when describing the deprecated CDS volatility curve configuration. When both the \lstinline!Strikes! and \lstinline!Expiries! are configured explicitly, it is clear that the \lstinline![EXPIRY]! field is populated from the list of expiries in turn and the \lstinline![STRIKE]! field is populated from the list of strikes in turn. If there are $m$ expiries in the \lstinline!Expiries! list and $n$ strikes in the \lstinline!Strikes! list, there will be $m \times n$ quotes created and searched for in the market data. If \lstinline!Expiries! are configured via the wildcard character, \lstinline!*!, all quotes in the market data matching the pattern \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/*/[STRIKE]! will be used if \lstinline![TERM]! has not been populated and all quotes in the market data matching the pattern \lstinline!INDEX_CDS_OPTION/RATE_LNVOL/[NAME]/[TERM]/*/[STRIKE]! will be used if \lstinline![TERM]! has been populated. Similarly for \lstinline!Strikes! configured via the wildcard character, \lstinline!*!.

The meaning of each of the elements in Listing \ref{lst:basecorr_configuration} is given below. 

\begin{itemize}
\item CurveId: Unique identifier of the base correlation structure
\item CurveDescription: A description of the base correlation structure, may be left blank.
\item Terms: Comma-separated list of tenors, sorted in increasing order, possibly a single term to represent a flat term structure in time-direction

\subsubsection{Securities}

Listing \ref{lst:security_configuration} shows the configuration of the Securities. Each Security name is associated with

\begin{itemize}
\item an optional SpreadQuote
\item an optional RecoveryRateQuote. Usually a pricer will fall back on the recovery rate associated to the credit curve
  involved in the pricing if no security specific recovery rate is given. If no credit curve is given either, a zero
  recovery rate will be assumed.
\end{itemize}

If no configuration is given for a security, in general a pricer will assume as zero spread and recovery rate. Notice
that in this case the spread and recovery will not be simulated and therefore also be excluded from the sensitivity and
stress analysis.

\subsubsection{Correlations}

Listing \ref{lst:correlation_configuration} shows the configuration of the Correlations. The Correlation type can be either CMSSpread or Generic. The former one is to configure the correlation between two CMS indexes, the latter one is to  generally configure the correlation between two indexes, e.g. between a CMS index and a IBOR index. Currently only ATM correlation curves or Flat correlation structures are supported. Correlation quotes may be loaded directly (by setting QuoteType to RATE) or calibrated from prices (set QuoteType to PRICE).  Moreover a flat zero correlation curve can be loaded (by setting  QuoteType to NULL). In this case market quotes are not needed to be provided. Currently only CMSSpread correlations can be calibrated. This is done using CMS Spread Options, and requires a CMSSpreadOption convention, SwaptionVolatility and DiscountCurve to be provided. OptionTenors can be a comma separated list of periods, 1Y,2Y etc, or a \lstinline!*! to indicate a wildcard. If a wildcard is provided, all relevant market data quotes are used.

\subsubsection{Bootstrap Configuration}
\label{sec:bootstrap_config}
The \lstinline!BootstrapConfig! node, outlined in listing \ref{lst:bootstrap_config_outline}, can be added to curve configurations that use a bootstrap algorithm to alter the default behaviour of the bootstrap algorithm.

\begin{longlisting}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<BootstrapConfig>
  <Accuracy>...</Accuracy>
  <GlobalAccuracy>...</GlobalAccuracy>
  <DontThrow>...</DontThrow>
  <MaxAttempts>...</MaxAttempts>
  <MaxFactor>...</MaxFactor>
  <MinFactor>...</MinFactor>
  <DontThrowSteps>...</DontThrowSteps>
</BootstrapConfig>
\end{minted}
\caption{\lstinline!BootstrapConfig! node outline}
\label{lst:bootstrap_config_outline}
\end{longlisting}

The meaning of each of the elements is:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline!Accuracy! [Optional]:
The accuracy with which the implied quote must match the market quote for each instrument in the curve bootstrap. This node should hold a positive real number. If omitted, the default value is \num[scientific-notation=true]{1.0e-12}.

\item \lstinline!GlobalAccuracy! [Optional]:
If the interpolation method in the bootstrap is global, e.g. cubic spline, the bootstrap routine needs to perform multiple iterative bootstraps of the curve to converge. After each such bootstrap of the full curve, the absolute value of the change between the current bootstrap and previous bootstrap for the curve value at each pillar is calculated. The global bootstrap is deemed to have converged if the maximum of these changes is less than the global accuracy or the accuracy from the \lstinline!Accuracy! node. This node should hold a positive real number. If omitted, the global accuracy is set equal to the accuracy from the \lstinline!Accuracy! node. This node is useful in some cases where a slightly less restrictive accuracy, than that given by the \lstinline!Accuracy! node, is needed for the global bootstrap.

\item \lstinline!DontThrow! [Optional]:
If this node is set to \lstinline!true!, the curve bootstrap does not throw an error when the bootstrap fails at a pillar. Instead, a curve value is sought at the failing pillar that minimises the absolute value of the difference between the implied quote and the market quote at that pillar. The minimum is sought between the minimum and maximum curve value that was used in the root finding routine that failed at the pillar. The number of steps used in this search is given by the \lstinline!DontThrowSteps! node below. This node should hold a boolean value. If omitted, the default value is \lstinline!false! i.e. the bootstrap throws an exception at the first pillar where the bootstrap fails.

\item \lstinline!MaxAttempts! [Optional]:
At each pillar, the bootstrap routine searches between a minimum curve value and a maximum curve value for a curve value that gives an implied quote that matches the market quote at that pillar. In some cases, the minimum curve value and maximum curve value are too restrictive and the bootstrap fails at a pillar. This node determines how many times the bootstrap should be attempted at each pillar. For example, if the node is set to 1, the bootstrap uses the minimum curve value and maximum curve value implied in the code and fails if a root is not found. If this node is set to 2 and the first attempt fails, the minimum curve value is reduced by a factor specified in the node \lstinline!MinFactor!, the maximum curve value is increased by a factor specified in the node \lstinline!MaxFactor! and a second attempt is made to find a root between the enlarged bounds. If no root is found, the bootstrap then fails at this pillar. This node should hold a positive integer. If omitted, the default value is 5.

\item \lstinline!MaxFactor! [Optional]:
This node is used only if \lstinline!MaxAttempts! is greater than 1. The meaning of this node is given in the description of the \lstinline!MaxAttempts! node. This node should hold a positive real number. If omitted, the default value is 2.0.

\item \lstinline!MinFactor! [Optional]:
This node is used only if \lstinline!MaxAttempts! is greater than 1. The meaning of this node is given in the description of the \lstinline!MaxAttempts! node. This node should hold a positive real number. If omitted, the default value is 2.0.

\item \lstinline!DontThrowSteps! [Optional]:
This node is used only if \lstinline!DontThrow! is \lstinline!true!. The meaning of this node is given in the description of the \lstinline!DontThrow! node. This node should hold a positive integer. If omitted, the default value is 10.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{One Dimensional Solver Configuration}
\label{sec:one_dim_solver_config}
The \lstinline!OneDimSolverConfig! node, outlined in Listing \ref{lst:one_dim_solver_config_outline}, can be added to certain curve configurations that lead to a one dimensional solver being used in the curve construction. For example, the \lstinline!EquityVolatility! curve configuration can lead to equity volatilities being stripped from equity option premiums. In this case, the \lstinline!OneDimSolverConfig! node can be added to the \lstinline!EquityVolatility! curve configuration to indicate how the solver should behave i.e.\ maximum number of evaluations, initial guess, accuracy etc. The various options are outlined below.

\begin{longlisting}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
<OneDimSolverConfig>
  <MaxEvaluations>...</MaxEvaluations>
  <InitialGuess>...</InitialGuess>
  <Accuracy>...</Accuracy>
  <MinMax>
    <Min>...</Min>
    <Max>...</Max>
  </MinMax>
  <!-- Step only needed if MinMax not provided. -->
  <Step>...</Step>
  <LowerBound>...</LowerBound>
  <UpperBound>...</UpperBound>
</OneDimSolverConfig>
\end{minted}
\caption{\lstinline!OneDimSolverConfig! node outline}
\label{lst:one_dim_solver_config_outline}
\end{longlisting}

The meaning of each of the elements is:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline!MaxEvaluations!:
This node should hold a positive integer. The maximum number of function evaluations that can be made by the solver.

\item \lstinline!InitialGuess!:
This node should hold a real number. The initial guess used by the solver.

\item \lstinline!Accuracy!:
This node should hold a positive real number. The accuracy used by the solver in the root find.

\item \lstinline!MinMax! [Optional]:
A node that holds a \lstinline!Min! and a \lstinline!Max! node each of which should hold a real number. This indicates that the solver should search for a root between the value in \lstinline!Min! and the value in \lstinline!Max!. The value in \lstinline!Min! should obviously be less than the value in \lstinline!Max!. This node is optional. If not provided, the \lstinline!Step! node below should be provided to set up a step based solver.

\item \lstinline!Step! [Optional]:
This node should hold a real number. The validation is a choice between \lstinline!MinMax! and \lstinline!Step! so that \lstinline!Step! can only be provided if \lstinline!MinMax! is not and vice versa. The value in \lstinline!Step! provides the solver with a step size to use in its search for a root.

\item \lstinline!LowerBound! [Optional]:
This node should hold a real number. It provides a lower bound for the search domain. If omitted, no lower bound is applied to the search domain.

\item \lstinline!UpperBound! [Optional]:
This node should hold a real number. It provides an upper bound for the search domain. If omitted, no upper bound is applied to the search domain. Obviously, if both \lstinline!LowerBound! and \lstinline!UpperBound! are provided, the value in \lstinline!LowerBound! should be less than the value in \lstinline!UpperBound!.

\subsection{Risk Factor Evolution Model}\label{sec:app_rfe}

ORE applies the cross asset model described in detail in \cite{Lichters} to evolve  the market through time. So far the
evolution model in ORE supports IR and FX risk factors for any number of currencies, Equity and Inflation as well as Credit. Extensions to full simulation of Commodity is planned. \\

The Cross Asset Model is based on the Linear Gauss Markov model (LGM) for interest rates, lognormal FX and equity 
processes, Dodgson-Kainth model for inflation, LGM or Extended Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model (CIR++) for credit, and a single-factor log-normal model for commodity curves.
We identify a single {\em domestic} currency; its LGM process,
which is labelled $z_0$; and a set of $n$ foreign currencies with associated LGM processes that are labelled $z_i$, 
$i=1,\dots,n$. 

We denote the equity spot price processes with state variables $s_j$ and the index of the denominating 
currency for the equity process as $\phi(j)$. The dividend yield corresponding to each equity process $s_j$ is denoted 
by $q_j$.

Following \cite{Lichters}, 13.27 - 13.29 we write the inflation processes 
in the domestic LGM measure with state variables $z_{I,k}$ and $y_{I,k}$ for $k=1,\ldots,K$
and the credit processes in the domestic LGM measure with state variables ${C,k}$ and $y_{C,k}$ for $k=1,\ldots,K$.
If we consider $n$ 
foreign exchange rates for converting foreign currency amounts into the single domestic currency by multiplication, 
$x_i$, $i=1,\dots,n$, then the cross asset model is given by the system of SDEs
\begin{eqnarray*}
dz_0 &=& \alpha_0\,dW_0^z \\
dz_i &=& \gamma_i\,dt + \alpha_i\,dW_i^z,  \qquad i>0 \\
\frac{d x_i}{x_i} &=& \mu_i\, dt + \sigma_i\,dW_i^x, \qquad i > 0 \\
\frac{d s_j}{s_j} &=& \mu_j^S\, dt + \sigma_j^S\,dW_j^S \\
dz_{I,k} &=& \alpha_{I,k}(t)dW_k^I \\
dy_{I,k} &=& \alpha_{I,k}(t)H_{I,k}(t)dW_k^I \\
dz_{C,k} &=& \alpha_{C,k}(t)dW_k^C \\
dy_{C,k} &=& H_{C,k}(t)\alpha_{C,k}(t)dW_k^C \\ \\
\gamma_i &=&
-\alpha_i^2\,H_i -\rho_{ii}^{zx}\,\sigma_i\,\alpha_i + \rho_{i0}^{zz}\,\alpha_i\,\alpha_0\,H_0\\
\mu_i &=& r_0 - r_i + \rho_{0i}^{zx}\,\alpha_0\,H_0\,\sigma_i\\
\mu_j^S &=& (r_{\phi(j)}(t) - q_j(t) + \rho_{0j}^{zs} \alpha_0 H_0 \sigma_j^S - \epsilon_{\phi(j)}
\rho_{j \phi(j)}^{sx}\sigma_j^S \sigma_{\phi(j)}) \\
r_i &=& f_i(0,t) + z_i(t)\,H'_i(t) + \zeta_i(t)\,H_i(t)\,H'_i(t),
\quad \zeta_i(t) = \int_0^t \alpha_i^2(s)\,ds  \\ \\
dW^\alpha_a\,dW^\beta_b &=& \rho^{\alpha\beta}_{ij}\,dt, \qquad \alpha, \beta \in \{z, x, I, C\}, \qquad a, b \text{
                              suitable indices }
%\zeta_i(t) &=& \int_0^t \alpha_i^2(s)\,ds,
%\qquad H_i(t) = \int_0^t e^{-\beta_i(s)} \,ds \\
%\beta_i(t) &=& \int_0^t \lambda_i(s)\,ds,
%\qquad \alpha_i(t) = \sigma_i^{HW}(t)\,e^{\beta(t)} \\
\end{eqnarray*}
where we have dropped time dependencies for readability, $f_i(0,t)$ is the instantaneous forward curve in currency $i$, 
and $\epsilon_i$ is an indicator such that $\epsilon_i = 1 - \delta_{0i}$, where $\delta$ is the Kronecker delta.

\medskip Parameters $H_i(t)$ and $\alpha_i(t)$ (or alternatively $\zeta_i(t)$) are LGM model parameters which determine,
together with the stochastic factor $z_i(t)$, the evolution of numeraire and zero bond prices in the LGM model:
\begin{align}
N(t) &= \frac{1}{P(0,t)}\exp\left\{H_t\, z_t + \frac{1}{2}H^2_t\,\zeta_t \right\}
\label{lgm1f_numeraire} \\

Note that the LGM model is closely related to the Hull-White model in T-forward measure \cite{Lichters}.

\medskip The parameters $H_{I,k}(t)$ and $\alpha_{I,k}(t)$ determine together with the factors $z_{I,k}(t), y_{I,k}(t)$
the evolution of the spot Index $I(t)$ and the forward index $\hat{I}(t,T) = P_I(t,T) / P_n(t,T)$ defined as the ratio
of the inflation linked zero bond and the nominal zero bond,

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \hat{I}(t,T) &=& \frac{\hat{I}(0,T)}{\hat{I}(0,t)} e^{(H_{I,k}(T)-H_{I,k}(t))z_{I,k}(t)+\tilde{V}(t,T)} \\
  I(t) &=& I(0) \hat{I}(0,t)e^{H_{I,k}(t)z_{I,k}(t)-y_{I,k}(t)-V(0,t)}
\end{eqnarray*}

with, in case of domestic currency inflation,

\begin{eqnarray*}
  V(t,T) &=& \frac{1}{2} \int_t^T (H_{I,k}(T)-H_{I,k}(s))^2 \alpha_{I,k}^2(s) ds \\
         & & - \rho^{zI}_{0,k} H_0(T) \int_t^T (H_{I,k}(t)-H_{I,k}(s))\alpha_0(s)\alpha_{I,k}(s)ds \\
  \tilde{V}(t,T) &=& V(t,T) - V(0,T) -V(0,t) \\
         &=& -\frac{1}{2}(H_{I,k}^2(T)-H_{I,k}^2(t))\zeta_{I,k}(t,0) \\
         & & +(H_{I,k}(T)-H_{I,k}(t)) \zeta_{I,k}(t,1) \\
         & & +(H_0(T)H_{I,k}(T) - H_0(t)H_{I,k}(t))\zeta_{0I}(t,0) \\
         & & -(H_0(T)-H_0(t))\zeta_{0I}(t,1) \\
  V(0,t) &=& \frac{1}{2}H_{I,k}^2(t)\zeta_{I,k}(t,0)-H_{I,k}(t)\zeta_{I,k}(t,1)+\frac{1}{2}\zeta_{I,k}(t,2) \\
         & & -H_0(t)H_{I,k}(t)\zeta_{0I}(t,0)+H_0(t)\zeta_{0I}(t,1) \\

\end{eqnarray*}

and for foreign currency inflation in currency $i>0$, with

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \tilde{V}(t,T) &=& V(t,T) -V(0,T) + V(0,T)
\end{eqnarray*}

and

\begin{eqnarray*}
  V(t,T) &=& \frac{1}{2}\int_t^T (H_{I,k}(T)-H_{I,k}(s))^2 \alpha_{I,k}(s) ds \\
  & & -\rho^{zI}_{0,k} \int_t^T H_0(s)\alpha_0(s)(H_{I,k}(T)-H_{I,k}(s)\alpha_{I,k}(s)) ds \\

\subsubsection*{Commodity}

Each commodity component models the commodity price curve as 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dF(t,T)}{F(t,T)} &=& \sigma\,e^{-\kappa\,(T-t)}\, dW(t)  \label{gabillon1f}
\end{eqnarray}
which is a single-factor version of the Gabillon (1991) model that is e.g. described in \cite{Lichters}. It can also be seen as the Schwartz (1997) model formulated in terms of forward curve dynamics. The extension to the full Gabillon model with two factors and time-dependent multiplier
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dF(t,T)}{F(t,T)} &=& \alpha(t)\,
\left( \sigma_S \,e^{-\kappa\,(T-t)}\, dW_S(t) + \sigma_L\,\left(1-e^{-\kappa\,(T-t)}\right)\,dW_L(t)\right) \label{gabillon2f}
\end{eqnarray}
for richer dynamics of the curve and accurate calibration to options will follow. 

The commodity components' Wiener processes can be correlated. However, the integration of commodity components into the overall CAM assumes zero correlations between commodities and non-commodity drivers for the time being.

To propagate the one-factor model, we can use an artificial (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) spot price process
\begin{align*}
dX(t) &= -\kappa\,X(t)\,dt + \sigma(t)\,dW(t), \qquad X(0)=0\\
X(t) &= X(s)\,e^{-\kappa(t-s)}+ \int_s^t \sigma\,e^{-\kappa(t-u)}\, dW(u)
\end{align*}
with 
\begin{align*}
F(t,T) &= F(0,T) \:\exp\left( X(t)\,e^{-\kappa\,(T-t)} - \frac{1}{2}\,(V(0,T)-V(t,T))  \right) \\
V(t,T) &= e^{-2\kappa T}\int_t^T\sigma^2\:e^{2\kappa u}\,du.
\end{align*}
Note that 
$$
\V[\ln F(T,T)] = \V[X(T)] 
$$
is the variance that is used in the pricing of a Futures Option which in turn is used in the calibration of the Schwartz model.

Alternatively, one can use the drift-free state variable $Y(t)=e^{\kappa t} X(t)$ with
\begin{align*}
dY(t) &= \sigma \: e^{\kappa \, t} \, dW(t).
\end{align*}
Both choices of state dynamics are possible in ORE.

\end{eqnarray*}

The expectation of the Inflation processes $z_{I,k}, y_{I,k}$ conditional on $\mathcal{F}_{t_0}$ at any time $t>t_0$ is
equal to $z_{I,k}(t_0)$ resp. $y_{I,k}(t_0)$ since both processes are drift free.

  \rho_{ab}^{IC}\int_s^t \alpha_{I,a} H_{C,b}(u) \alpha_{C,b}(u) du\\
  \mathrm{Cov}[ \Delta y_{I,a}, \Delta z_{C,b} ] &=&

  \rho_{ab}^{IC}\int_s^t \alpha_{I,a} H_{I,a}(u) \alpha_{C,b}(u) H_{C,b}(u) du\\
\end{eqnarray*}

The equity/credit covariances over the interval $[s,t] := [t_0, t_0+\Delta t]$ (conditional on $\mathcal{F}_{t_0}$) are as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	Cov \left[\Delta ln[s_i], \Delta z_{C,j} \right] &=&
	\rho_{\phi(i)j}^{zC} \int_s^t (H_{\phi(i)} (t) - H_{\phi(i)} (u)) \alpha_{\phi(i)} (u) \alpha_{C,j} (u) du\\
	&&+ \rho_{ij}^{sC} \int_s^t \sigma_i^S (u) \alpha_{C,j} (u) du\\	
	Cov \left[\Delta ln[s_i], \Delta y_{C,j} \right] &=&
	\rho_{\phi(i)j}^{zC} \int_s^t (H_{\phi(i)} (t) - H_{\phi(i)} (u)) \alpha_{\phi(i)} (u) H_{C,j} (u) \alpha_{C,j} (u) du\\
	&&+ \rho_{ij}^{sC} \int_s^t \sigma_i^S (u) H_{C,j} (u) \alpha_{C,j} (u) du\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Change of Measure}

We can change measure from LGM to the T-Forward measure by applying a shift transformation to the $H$ parameter of the domestic LGM process, as explained in \cite{Lichters} and shown in Example 12, section \ref{sec:longterm}. This does not involve amending the system of SDEs above.

\medskip
\noindent
In the following we show how to move from the LGM to the Bank Account measure when we start with the Cross Asset Model in the LGM measure. This description and the implementation in ORE is limited so far to the cross currency case.

First note that the stochastic Bank Account (BA) can be written
\begin{align*}
B(t) &= \frac{1}{P(0,t)}\exp\left(\int_0^t (H_t-H_s)\,\alpha_s\,dW_s^B + \frac{1}{2}\int_0^t (H_t-H_s)^2\,\alpha^2_s\,ds \right)
\end{align*} 
with Wiener processes in the BA measure. We can express this in terms of the domestic LGM's state variable $z(t)$ and an auxiliary random variable $y(t)$
\begin{align*}
B(t) &= \frac{1}{P(0,t)}\exp\left(H(t)\,z(t) - y(t) + \frac{1}{2} \left(H^2(t)\,\zeta_0(t) + \zeta_2(t)\right)\right)
\intertext{with}
dz(t) &= \alpha(t)\,dW^B(t) - H(t)\,\alpha^2(t)\,dt \\
dy(t) &= H(t)\,\alpha(t)\,dW^B(t) \\
\zeta_n(t) &= \int_0^t \alpha^2(s)\,H^n(s) \,ds
\end{align*}
Note the drift of LGM state variable $z(t)$ in the BA measure and the auxiliary state variable $y(t)$ which is driven by the same Wiener process as $z(t)$. The instantaneous correlation of $dz$ and $dy$ is one, but the terminal correlation of $z(t)$ and $y(t)$ is less than one because of their different volatility functions. This is all we need to switch measure to BA in a pure domestic currency case.

To change measure in the cross currency case we need to make changes to the SDE beyond adding an auxiliary state variable $y$ and adding a drift to the domestic LGM state. Let us write down the SDEs in the LGM and BA measure with respective drift terms that ensure martingale properties.

SDE in the LGM measure
\begin{align*}
dz_0 &= \alpha_0\,dW_0^z \\
dz_i &= \left(-\alpha_i^2\,H_i -\rho_{ii}^{zx}\,\sigma_i\,\alpha_i + {\color{red} \rho_{i0}^{zz}\,\alpha_i\,\alpha_0\,H_0}\right)\,dt + \alpha_i\,dW_i^z \\
d\ln x_i &= \left(r_0 - r_i - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2_i + {\color{red} \rho_{0i}^{zx}\,\alpha_0\,H_0\,\sigma_i} \right)\, dt + \sigma_i\,dW_i^x \\
\intertext{SDE in the BA measure}
{\color{blue}dy_0}  & = {\color{blue}\alpha_0\,H_0\,d\widetilde W_0^z} \\
dz_0 &= {\color{blue}-\alpha_0^2\,H_0\,dt} + \alpha_0\,d\widetilde W_0^z \\
dz_i &= \left(-\alpha_i^2\,H_i-\rho_{ii}^{zx}\,\sigma_i\,\alpha_i\right)\,dt + \alpha_i\,d\widetilde W_i^z \\
d\ln x_i &= \left(r_0 - r_i - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2_i\right)\, dt + \sigma_i\,d\widetilde W_i^x,\qquad 
r_i = f_i(0,t) + z_i(t)\,H'_i(t) + \zeta_i(t)\,H_i(t)\,H'_i(t)
\end{align*}

Blue terms are {\color{blue}added}, red terms are {\color{red}removed} when moving from LGM to BA.

\medskip\noindent

These drift term changes lead to the following changes in conditional expectations 
\begin{align*}
\E[\Delta y_0] =& 0 \\
\E[\Delta z_0] =& - {\color{blue}\int_s^t H_0\,\alpha_0^2\,du}  \\
\E[\Delta z_i] =& - \int_s^t H_i\,\alpha_i^2\,du 
  - \rho^{zx}_{ii}\int_s^t \sigma_i^x\,\alpha_i\,du
  + {\color{red}\rho^{zz}_{0i} \int_s^t H_0\,\alpha_0\,\alpha_i\,du } \\
\E[\Delta \ln x] 
  =& \left(H_0(t)-H_0(s)\right) z_0(s) -\left(H_i(t)-H_i(s)\right)\,z_i(s)\\
  &+ \ln \left( \frac{P^n_0(0,s)}{P^n_0(0,t)} \frac{P^n_i(0,t)}{P^n_i(0,s)}\right) \\
  & - \frac12 \int_s^t (\sigma^x_i)^2\,du \\
  &+\frac12 \left(H^2_0(t)\, \zeta_0(t) -  H^2_0(s) \,\zeta_0(s) - \int_s^t H_0^2 \alpha_0^2\,du\right)\\
  &-\frac12 \left(H^2_i(t) \,\zeta_i(t) -  H^2_i(s) \,\zeta_i(s) - \int_s^t H_i^2 \alpha_i^2\,du\right)\\
  & + {\color{red} \rho^{zx}_{0i} \int_s^t H_0\, \alpha_0\, \sigma^x_i\,du} \\
  &  - \int_s^t \left(H_i(t)-H_i\right)\gamma_i \,du \qquad\mbox{with}\qquad
  \gamma_i = -\alpha_i^2\,H_i -\rho_{ii}^{zx}\,\sigma_i\,\alpha_i + {\color{red}\rho_{i0}^{zz}\,\alpha_i\,\alpha_0\,H_0}   \\
  & + {\color{blue}\int_s^t \left(H_0(t)-H_0\right)\,\gamma_0 \,du \qquad \mbox{with}\qquad \gamma_0 = - H_0\,\alpha_0^2}
\end{align*}
and the following additional variances and covariances
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Var}[\Delta y_0] =& \int_s^t \alpha_0^2\,H_0^2\,du \\
\mathrm{Cov}[\Delta y_0, \Delta z_i] =& \rho^{zz}_{0i} \int_s^t \alpha_0\,H_0\,\alpha_i\,du \\
\mathrm{Cov}[\Delta y_0, \Delta \ln x_i] =& \int_s^t \left(H_0(t)-H_0\right) \alpha_0^2\,H_0\,du \\
&  - \rho^{zz}_{0i}\int_s^t \alpha_0\,H_0\left(H_i(t)-H_i\right)\, \alpha_i \,du \\
&  +\rho^{zx}_{0i}\int_s^t \alpha_0 \, H_0\,\sigma^x_i \,du 
%\mathrm{Var}[\Delta z_i] =& \int_s^t \alpha_i^2\,du \\
%\mathrm{Var}[\Delta \ln x_i] =&
%      \int_s^t \left(H_0(t)-H_0\right)^2 \alpha_0^2\,du \nonumber\\
%      & -2\rho^{zz}_{0i} \int_s^t \left(H_i(t)-H_i\right) \alpha_i\left(H_0(t)-H_0\right) \alpha_0\,du
%  \nonumber\\
%      &+ 2\rho^{zx}_{0i}\int_s^t \left(H_0(t)-H_0\right)\alpha_0 \,\sigma^x_i\,du \nonumber\\
%      &- 2\rho^{zx}_{ii}\int_s^t \left(H_i(t)-H_i\right)\alpha_i \,\sigma^x_i\,du\nonumber\\
%      &+ \int_s^t \left(H_i(t)-H_i\right)^2\alpha_i^2 \,du
%  \nonumber\\
%      &+ \int_s^t(\sigma^x_i)^2\,du \\
%\mathrm{Cov} [\Delta z_i, \Delta z_j] =& \rho^{zz}_{ij}\int_s^t \alpha_i\,\alpha_j\,du \\
%\mathrm{Cov} [\Delta z_i, \Delta \ln x_j] =& \rho^{zz}_{0i}\int_s^t \left(H_0(t)-H_0\right)
%  \alpha_0\,\alpha_i\,du \nonumber\\
%      &- \rho^{zz}_{ij}\int_s^t \alpha_i \,\alpha_j \,\left(H_j(t)-H_j\right) \,du \nonumber\\
%      &+\rho^{zx}_{ij}\int_s^t \alpha_i \, \sigma^x_j \,du.
\end{align*}

Example 36 in section \ref{example:36} illustrates the effect of the choice of measure on exposure simulations.

\subsection{Exposures}\label{sec:app_exposure}

In ORE we use the following exposure definitions
\begin{align}
\EE(t) = \EPE(t) &= \E^N\left[ \frac{(NPV(t)-C(t))^+}{N(t)} \right] \label{EE}\\
\ENE(t) &= \E^N\left[ \frac{(-NPV(t)+C(t))^+}{N(t)} \right] \label{ENE}
\end{align}
where $\NPV(t)$ stands for the netting set NPV and $C(t)$ is the collateral balance\footnote{$C(t)>0$ means that we have
  {\em received} collateral from the counterparty} at time $t$. Note that these exposures are expectations of values
discounted with numeraire $N$ (in ORE the Linear Gauss Markov model's numeraire) to today, and expectations are taken in
the measure associated with numeraire $N$. These are the exposures which enter into unilateral CVA and DVA calculation,
respectively, see next section. Note that we sometimes label the expected exposure (\ref{EE}) EPE, not to be confused
with the Basel III Expected Positive Exposure below.

\medskip
Basel III defines a number of exposures each of which is a 'derivative' of Basel's Expected Exposure:
\begin{align}
\intertext{Expected Exposure}
EE_B(t) &= \E[\max(NPV(t) - C(t), 0)] \label{basel_ee}\\
\intertext{Expected Positive Exposure}
EPE_B(T) &= \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t<T} EE_B(t)\cdot \Delta t  \label{basel_epe} \\
\intertext{Effective Expected Exposure, recursively defined as running maximum}
EEE_B(t) &= \max(EEE_B(t-\Delta t), EE_B(t)) \label{basel_eee}\\
\intertext{Effective Expected Positive Exposure}
EEPE_B(T) &= \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t<T} EEE_B(t)\cdot \Delta t \label{basel_eepe}
\end{align}
The last definition, Effective EPE, is used in Basel documents since Basel II for Exposure At Default and capital
calculation. Following \cite{bcbs128,bcbs189} the time averages in the EPE and EEPE calculations are taken over {\em the
  first year} of the exposure evolution (or until maturity if all positions of the netting set mature before one year).

\medskip
To compute $EE_B(t)$ consistently in a risk-neutral setting, we compound (\ref{EE}) with the deterministic discount factor $P(t)$ up to horizon $t$:
$$
EE_B(t) = \frac{1}{P(t)} \:\EE(t)
$$

Finally, we define another common exposure measure, the {\em Potential Future Exposure} (PFE), as a (typically high)
quantile $\alpha$ of the NPV distribution through time, similar to Value at Risk but at the upper end of the NPV
distribution:

\begin{align}
  \PFE_\alpha(t) = \left(\inf\left\{ x | F_t(x) \geq \alpha\right\}\right)^+ \label{PFE}
\end{align}

where $F_t$ is the cumulative NPV distribution function at time $t$. Note that we also take the positive part to ensure
that PFE is a positive measure even if the quantile yields a negative value which is possible in extreme cases.
 
\subsection{CVA and DVA}\label{sec:app_cvadva}

Using the expected exposures in \ref{sec:app_exposure} unilateral discretised CVA and DVA are given by \cite{Lichters}
\begin{align}
\CVA &= \sum_{i} \PD(t_{i-1},t_i)\times\LGD\times \EPE(t_i) \label{CVA}\\
\DVA &= \sum_{i} \PD_{Bank}(t_{i-1},t_i)\times\LGD_{Bank}\times \ENE(t_i) \label{DVA}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align*}
\EPE(t) & \mbox{ expected exposure (\ref{EE})}\\
\ENE(t) & \mbox{ expected negative exposure (\ref{ENE})}\\
PD(t_i,t_j) & \mbox{ counterparty probability of default in } [t_i;t_j]\\
PD_{Bank}(t_i,t_j) & \mbox{ our probability of default in } [t_i;t_j]\\
LGD & \mbox{ counterparty loss given default}\\
LGD_{Bank} & \mbox{ our loss given default}\\
\end{align*}

Note that the choice $t_i$ in the arguments of $\EPE(t_i)$ and $\ENE(t_i)$ means we are choosing the {\em advanced}
rather than the {\em postponed} discretization of the CVA/DVA integral \cite{BrigoMercurio}. This choice can be easily
changed in the ORE source code or made configurable. \\

Moreover, formulas (\ref{CVA}, \ref{DVA}) assume independence of credit and other market risk factors, so that $\PD$ and
$\LGD$ factors are outside the expectations. With the extension of ORE to credit asset classes and in particular for
wrong-way-risk analysis, CVA/DVA formulas is generaised and is applicable to calculations with dynamic credit

\begin{align}
\CVA^{dyn} &= \sum_{i} \E^N\left[\frac{\PD^{dyn}(t_{i-1},t_i)\times \PE(t_i)}{N(t)} \right]\times\LGD \label{CVA_dynamic} \\
\DVA^{dyn} &= \sum_{i} \E^N\left[\frac{\PD^{dyn}_{Bank}(t_{i-1},t_i)\times \NE(t_i)}{N(t)} \right]\times\LGD_{Bank} \label{DVA_dynamic}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align*}
\PE(t) & \mbox{ random variables representing positive exposure at } t: (NPV(t)-C(t))^+\\
\NE(t) & \mbox{ random variables representing negative exposure at } t: (-NPV(t)+C(t))^+\\
PD^{dyn}(t_i,t_j) & \mbox{ random variables representing counterparty probability of default in } [t_i;t_j]\\
PD^{dyn}_{Bank}(t_i,t_j) & \mbox{ random variables representing our probability of default in } [t_i;t_j]\\
LGD & \mbox{ counterparty loss given default}\\
LGD_{Bank} & \mbox{ our loss given default}\\
\end{align*}

\subsection{FVA}\label{sec:fva}

%Any exposure (uncollateralised or residual after taking collateral into account) gives rise to funding cost or benefits
%depending on the sign of the residual position. This can be expressed as a Funding Value Adjustment (FVA). A simple
%definition of FVA can be given in a very similar fashion as the sum of unilateral CVA and DVA which we defined by
%(\ref{CVA},\ref{DVA}), namely as an expectation of exposures times funding spreads:
%\begin{align}
%  \FVA &= \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n f_b(t_{i-1},t_i)\,\delta_i \, \E^N\left[S_C(t_{i-1})\, S_B(t_{i-1})\, (\NPV(t_i))^+\,
%         D(t_i)\right]}_{\mbox{Funding Benefit Adjustment (FBA)}}\nonumber\\
%       & {} - \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n f_l(t_{i-1},t_i)\,\delta_i \, \E^N\left[S_C(t_{i-1})\, S_B(t_{i-1})\, (-\NPV(t_i))^+\, D(t_i)\right]}_{\mbox{Funding Cost Adjustment (FCA)}}\label{eq_simple_fva}
%\end{align}
%where
%\begin{align*}
%D(t_i) & \mbox{ stochastic discount factor, $1/N(t_i)$ in LGM}\\
%\NPV(t_i) & \mbox{ portfolio value after potential collateralization}\\
%S_C(t_j) & \mbox{ survival probability of the counterparty}\\
%S_B(t_j) & \mbox{ survival probability of the bank}\\
%f_b(t_j) & \mbox{ borrowing spread for the bank relative to the collateral compounding rate}\\
%f_l(t_j) & \mbox{ lending spread for the bank relative to the collateral compounding rate}
%\end{align*}
%For details see e.g. Chapter 14 in Gregory \cite{Gregory12} and the discussion in \cite{Lichters}.

Any exposure (uncollateralised or residual after taking collateral into account) gives rise to funding cost or benefits
depending on the sign of the residual position. This can be expressed as a Funding Value Adjustment (FVA). A simple
definition of FVA can be given in a very similar fashion as the sum of unilateral CVA and DVA which we defined by
(\ref{CVA},\ref{DVA}), namely as an expectation of exposures times funding spreads:
\begin{align}
  \FVA &= \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n f_l(t_{i-1},t_i)\,\delta_i \, \E^N\left\{S_C(t_{i-1})\, S_B(t_{i-1})\, [-\NPV(t_i)+C(t_i)]^+\,
         D(t_i)\right\}}_{\mbox{Funding Benefit Adjustment (FBA)}}\nonumber\\
       & {} - \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n f_b(t_{i-1},t_i)\,\delta_i \, \E^N\left\{S_C(t_{i-1})\, S_B(t_{i-1})\, [\NPV(t_i)-C(t_i)]^+\, D(t_i)\right\}}_{\mbox{Funding Cost Adjustment (FCA)}}\label{eq_simple_fva}
%  \FVA &= - \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n f_b(t_{i-1},t_i)\,\delta_i \, \E^N\left[S_C(t_{i-1})\, S_B(t_{i-1})\, (\NPV(t_i))^+\,
 %        D(t_i)\right]}_{\mbox{Funding Cost Adjustment (FCA)}}\nonumber\\
 %      & {} \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n f_l(t_{i-1},t_i)\,\delta_i \, \E^N\left[S_C(t_{i-1})\, S_B(t_{i-1})\, (-\NPV(t_i))^+\, D(t_i)\right]}_{\mbox{Funding Benefit Adjustment (FBA)}}\label{eq_simple_fva}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align*}
D(t_i) & \mbox{ stochastic discount factor, $1/N(t_i)$ in LGM}\\
\NPV(t_i) & \mbox{ portfolio value at time } t_i\\
C(t_i) & \mbox{Collateral account balance at time } t_i \\ 
S_C(t_j) & \mbox{ survival probability of the counterparty}\\
S_B(t_j) & \mbox{ survival probability of the bank}\\
f_b(t_j) & \mbox{ borrowing spread for the bank relative to OIS flat}\\
f_l(t_j) & \mbox{ lending spread for the bank relative to OIS flat}
\end{align*}
For details see e.g. Chapter 14 in Gregory \cite{Gregory12} and the discussion in \cite{Lichters}.

\medskip
The reasoning leading to the expression above is as follows. Consider, for example, a single partially collateralised derivative (no collateral at all or CSA with a significant threshold) between us (the Bank) and counterparty 1 (trade 1). 

We assume that we enter into an offsetting trade with (hypothetical) counterparty 2 which is perfectly collateralised (trade 2). We label the NPV of trade 1 and 2 $\NPV_{1,2}$ respectively (from our perspective, excluding CVA). Then $\NPV_2=-\NPV_1$. The respective collateral amounts due to trade 1 and 2 are $C_1$ and $C_2$ from our perspective. Because of the perfect collateralisation of trade 2 we assume $C_2=\NPV_2$. The imperfect collateralisation of trade 1 means $C_1 \ne \NPV_1$. The net collateral balance from our perspective is then $C=C_1+C_2$ which can be written $C=C_1+C_2 = C_1 + \NPV_2 = -\NPV_1 + C_1$.

\begin{itemize}
\item If $C>0$ we receive net collateral and pay the overnight rate on this notional amount. On the other hand we can invest the received collateral and earn our lending rate, so that we have a benefit proportional to the lending spread $f_l$ (lending rate minus overnight rate). It is a benefit assuming $f_l >0$. $C>0$ means $-\NPV_1 + C_1 > 0$ so that we can cover this case with ``lending notional'' $[-\NPV_1 + C_1]^+$.
\item If $C<0$ we post collateral amount $-C$ and receive the overnight rate on this amount. Amount $-C$ needs to be funded in the market, and we pay our borrowing rate on it. This leads to a funding cost proportional to the borrowing spread $f_b$ (borrowing rate minus overnight). $C<0$ means $\NPV_1 - C_1 > 0$, so that we can cover this case with ``borrowing notional'' $[\NPV_1 - C_1]^+$. If the borrowing spread is positive, this term proportional to $f_b \times [\NPV_1 - C_1]^+$ is indeed a cost and therefore needs to be subtracted from the benefit above.
\end{itemize}
   
Formula \eqref{eq_simple_fva} evaluates these funding cost components on the basis of the original trade's or portfolio's $\NPV$. Perfectly collateralised portfolios hence do not contribute to FVA because under the hedging fiction, they are hedged with a perfectly collateralised opposite portfolio, so any collateral payments on portfolio 1 are canceled out by those of the opposite sign on portfolio 2.

\subsection{COLVA}

When the CSA defines a collateral compounding rate that deviates from the overnight rate, this gives rise to another
value adjustment labeled COLVA \cite{Lichters}. In the simplest case the deviation is just given by a constant spread
$\Delta$:
\begin{align}
\COLVA &= \E^N\left[ \sum_i -C(t_i)\cdot \Delta \cdot \delta_i \cdot D(t_{i+1}) \right]
\label{COLVA}
\end{align}
where $C(t)$ is the collateral balance\footnote{see \ref{sec:app_exposure}, $C(t)>0$ means that we have {\em received}
  collateral from the counterparty} at time $t$ and $D(t)$ is the stochastic discount factor $1/N(t)$ in LGM. Both
$C(t)$ and
$N(t)$ are computed in ORE's Monte Carlo framework, and the expectation yields the desired adjustment. \\
 
Replacing the constant spread by a time-dependent deterministic function in ORE is straight forward. 
  
\subsection{Collateral Floor Value}

A less trivial extension of the simple COLVA calculation above, also covered in ORE, is the case where the deviation
between overnight rate and collateral rate is stochastic itself. A popular example is a CSA under which the collateral
rate is the overnight rate {\em floored at zero}. To work out the value of this CSA feature one can take the difference
of discounted margin cash flows with and without the floor feature. It is shown in \cite{Lichters} that the following
formula is a good approximation to the collateral floor value
\begin{align}
\Pi_{Floor} &= \E^N\left[ \sum_i -C(t_i)\cdot (-r(t_i))^+\cdot\delta_i \cdot D(t_{i+1}) \right]
\label{CSA_floor_value_approx}
\end{align}
where $r$ is the stochastic overnight rate and $(-r)^+ = r^+ - r$ is the difference between floored and 'un-floored' compounding rate. \\

Taking both collateral spread and floor into account, the value adjustment is 
\begin{align}
\Pi_{Floor,\Delta} &= \E^N\left[ \sum_i -C(t_i)\cdot ((r(t_i)-\Delta)^+-r(t_i))\cdot\delta_i \cdot D(t_{i+1}) \right] 
\label{CSA_floor_value_approx_2}
\end{align}

\subsection{Dynamic Initial Margin and MVA}\label{sec:app_dim}

The introduction of Initial Margin posting in non-cleared OTC derivatives business reduces residual credit exposures and
the associated value adjustments, {\bf CVA} and {\bf DVA}.

On the other hand, it gives rise to additional funding cost. The value of the latter is referred to as Margin Value Adjustment ({\bf MVA}).\\

To quantify these two effects one needs to model Initial Margin under future market scenarios, i.e. Dynamic Initial Margin ({\bf DIM}). Potential approaches comprise 
\begin{itemize}
\item Monte Carlo VaR embedded into the Monte Carlo simulation
\item Regression-based methods
\item Delta VaR under scenarios
\item ISDA's Standard Initial Margin (SIMM) under scenarios
\end{itemize} 

We skip the first option as too computationally expensive for ORE. In the current ORE release we focus on a relatively
simple regression approach as in \cite{Anfuso2016,LichtersEtAl}. Consider the netting set values $\NPV(t)$ and $\NPV(t+\Delta)$ that
are spaced one margin period of risk $\Delta$ apart. Moreover, let $F(t,t+\Delta)$ denote cumulative netting set cash
flows between time $t$ and $t+\Delta$, converted into the NPV currency. Let $X(t)$ then denote the netting set value
change during the margin period of risk excluding cash flows in that period:
$$
X(t) = \NPV(t+\Delta) + F(t, t+\Delta) - \NPV(t) 
$$  
ignoring discounting/compounding over the margin period of risk. We actually want to determine the distribution of
$X(t)$ conditional on the `state of the world' at time $t$, and pick a high (99\%) quantile to determine the Initial
Margin amount for each time $t$. Instead of working out the distribution, we content ourselves with estimating the
conditional variance $\V(t)$ or standard deviation $S(t)$ of $X(t)$, assuming a normal distribution and scaling $S(t)$
to the desired 99\% quantile by multiplying with the usual factor $\alpha=2.33$ to get an estimate of the Dynamic
Initial Margin $\DIM$:
$$
\V(t) = \E_t[X^2] - \E_t^2[X], \qquad S(t)=\sqrt{\V(t)}, \qquad \DIM(t) = \alpha \,S(t)
$$ 
We further assume that $\E_t[X]$ is small enough to set it to the expected value of $X(t)$ across all Monte Carlo
samples $X$ at time $t$ (rather than estimating a scenario dependent mean). The remaining task is then to estimate the
conditional expectation $\E_t[X^2]$. We do this in the spirit of the Longstaff Schwartz method using regression of
$X^2(t)$ across all Monte Carlo samples at a given time. As a regressor (in the one-dimensional case) we could use
$\NPV(t)$ itself. However, we rather choose to use an adequate market point (interest rate, FX spot rate) as regression
variable $x$, because this is generalised more easily to the multi-dimensional case. As regression basis functions we
use polynomials, i.e. regression functions of the form $c_0 + c_1\,x + c_2\,x^2 + ...+ c_n\,x^n$ where the order $n$ of
the polynomial can be selected by the user. Choosing the lowest order $n=0$, we obtain the simplest possible estimate,
the variance of $X$ across all samples at time $t$, so that we apply a single $\DIM(t)$ irrespective of the 'state of
the world' at time $t$ in that case.  The extension to multi-dimensional regression is also implemented in ORE. The user
can choose several regressors simultaneously (e.g. a EUR rate, a USD rate, USD/EUR spot FX rate, etc.) in order order to
cover complex multi-currency portfolios.

\medskip
Given the DIM estimate along all paths, we can next work out the Margin Value Adjustment \cite{Lichters} in discrete form
%{\color{red}
\begin{align}
\MVA &= \sum_{i=1}^n (f_b - s_I)\, \delta_i\: S_C(t_i)\: S_B(t_i) \times \E^N\left[
\DIM(t_i)\,D(t_i)\right]. \label{MVA} 
\end{align}
%}
with borrowing spread $f_b$ as in the FVA section \ref{sec:fva} and spread $s_I$ received on initial margin, both
spreads relative to the cash collateral rate.

\subsection{KVA (CCR)}\label{sec:app_kva}

The KVA is calculated for the Counterparty Credit Risk Capital charge
(CCR) following the IRB method concisely  described in
\cite{Gregory15}, Appendix 8A.
It is following the Basel rules by computing risk capital as the
product of alpha weighted  exposure at default, worst case probability
of default at 99.9  and a maturity adjustment factor also described in
the Basel annex 4.
The risk capital charges are discounted with a capital discount factor
and summed up to  give the total CCR KVA after being multiplied with
the risk  weight and a capital charge (following the RWA method).

\medskip Basel II internal rating based (IRB) estimate of worst case
probability of  default: large homogeneous pool (LHP) approximation of
Vasicek (1997), KVA regulatory probability of default is the worst
case probability of default floored at 0.03 (the latter is valid for 
corporates and banks, no such floor applies to sovereign counterparties):
$$
\PD_{99.9\%} = \max\left(floor, N \left(\frac{N^{-1}(\PD) + \sqrt{\rho}
  N^{-1}(0.999)}{\sqrt{1 - \rho}}\right) - \PD\right)
$$
$N$ is the cumulative standard normal distribution,

$$
\rho = 0.12 \frac{1 - e^{-50 \PD}}{1 - e^{-50}} + 0.24 \left(1 - \frac{1 -
  e^{-50 \PD}}{1 - e^{-50}}\right)
$$

\medskip Maturity adjustment factor for RWA method capped at 5, floored at 1:
$$
\MA(\PD, M) = \min\left(5, \max\left(1, \frac{1 + (M - 2.5) B(\PD)}{1 - 1.5 B(\PD)}\right)\right)
$$
\medskip where $B(\PD) = (0.11852 - 0.05478 \ln(\PD))^2$ and M is the
effective  maturity of the portfolio (capped at 5):

$$M = \min\left(5, 1 + \frac{\sum\limits_{t_k > 1yr} \EE_B(t_k)\Delta t_k
  B(0,t_k)}{\sum\limits_{t_k \leq 1yr} \EEE_B(t_k)\Delta t_k B(0,t_k)}\right)
$$

\medskip where $B(0,t_k)$ is the risk-free discount factor from the
simulation  date $t_k$ to today, $\Delta t_k$ is the difference
between time points, 
$\EE_B(t_k)$ is the expected (Basel) exposure at time $t_k$ and $\EEE_B(t_k)$ is the
associated effective expected exposure.

\medskip 
Expected risk capital at $t_i$:
$$
\RC(t_i) = EAD(t_i) \times LGD \times \PD_{99.9\%} \times \MA(\PD, M)
$$
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\EAD(t_i) = \alpha \times \EEPE(t_i)$
\item $\EEPE(t_i)$ is estimated as the time average of the running maximum of $\EPE(t)$ over the time interval $t_i\leq t\leq t_i+1$
\item $\alpha$ is the multiplier resulting from the IRB calculations (Basel II defines a supervisory alpha of 1.4, but gives banks the option to estimate their own $\alpha$,subject to a floor of 1.2).
\item the maturity adjustment MA is derived from the EPE profile for times $t\geq t_i$
\end{itemize}

\medskip 
$\KVA_{CCR}$ is the sum of the expected risk capital amount discounted at {\em capital discount rate} $r_{cd}$ and compounded at rate given by the product of {\em capital hurdle} $h$ and {\em regulatory adjustment} $a$:
$$
\KVA_{CCR} = \sum_i \RC(t_i) \times \frac{1}{ (1 + r_{cd})^{\delta(t_{i-1}, t_i)}} \times \delta(t_{i-1}, t_i) \times h \times a
$$
assuming Actual/Actual day count to compute the year factions $delta$.

In ORE we compute KVA CCR from both perspectives - ``our'' KVA driven by EPE and the counterparty default risk, and similarly ``their'' KVA driven by ENE and our default risk.

\subsection{KVA (BA-CVA)}\label{sec:app_kva_cva}

This section briefly summarizes the calculation of a capital value adjustment associated with the CVA capital charge (in the basic approach, BA-CVA) as introduced in Basel III \cite{bcbs189, d325, d424}. ORE implements the {\em stand-alone} capital charge $\SCVA$ for a netting set and computes a KVA for it\footnote{In the reduced version of BA-CVA, where hedges are not recognized, the total BA-CVA capital charge across all counterparties $c$ is given by
$$
K = \sqrt{\left(\rho \sum_c \SCVA_c\right)^2 +(1-\rho^2)\sum_c \SCVA_c^2}
$$  
with supervisory correlation $\rho=0.5$ to reflect that the credit spread risk factors across counterparties are not perfectly correlated. Each counterparty $\SCVA_c$ is given by a sum over all netting sets with this counterparty.}. In the basic approach, the stand-alone capital charge for a netting set is given by
$$
\SCVA = \RW_c\cdot M\cdot \EEPE \cdot\DF
$$
with 
\begin{itemize}
\item supervisory risk weight $\RW_c$ for the counterparty;
\item effective netting set maturity $M$ as in section \ref{sec:app_kva} (for a bank using IMM to calculate EAD), but without applying a cap of 5;
\item supervisory discount $\DF$ for the netting set which is equal to one for banks using IMM to calculate $\EEPE$ and $\DF=\left(1-\exp\left(-0.05\,M\right)\right)/(0.05\,M)$ for banks not using IMM to calculate $\EEPE$. 
\end{itemize}

The associated capital value adjustment is then computed for each netting set's stand-alone CVA charge as above
$$
\KVA_{BA-\CVA} = \sum_i \SCVA(t_i) \times \frac{1}{ (1 + r_{cd})^{\delta(t_{i-1}, t_i)}} \times \delta(t_{i-1}, t_i) \times h \times a
$$
with 
$$
\SCVA(t_i) = \RW_c \cdot M(t_i)\cdot \EEPE(t_i)\cdot\DF
$$
where we derive both $M$ and EEPE from the EPE profile for times $t\geq t_i$.

In ORE we compute KVA BA-CVA from both perspectives - ``our'' KVA driven by EPE and the counterparty risk weight, and similarly ``their'' KVA driven by ENE and our risk weight. \\

Note: Banks that use the BA-CVA for calculating CVA capital requirements are allowed to cap the maturity adjustment factor $\MA(\PD,M)$ in section \ref{sec:app_kva} at 1 for netting sets that contribute to CVA capital, if using the IRB approach for CCR capital.

\subsection{Collateral Model}\label{sec:app_collateral}

The collateral model implemented in ORE is based on the evolution of collateral account balances along each Monte Carlo
path taking into account thresholds, minimum transfer amounts and independent amounts defined in the CSA, as well as
margin periods of risk.

ORE computes the collateral requirement (aka \emph{Credit Support Amount}) through time along each Monte Carlo path
\begin{align}\label{eq:CSA}
CSA(t_m) &= 
\begin{cases}
\max(0, V_{set}(t_m) - I_A - T_{hold}),& V_{set}(t_m) - I_A \ge 0 \\
\min(0, V_{set}(t_m) - I_A + T_{hold}),& V_{set}(t_m) - I_A < 0
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $V_{set}(t_m)$ is the value of the netting set as of
  time $t_m$,
  \item $T_{hold}$ is the threshold exposure below which no collateral is
  required (possibly asymmetric),
%\item $MTA$ is the minimum transfer amount for collateral margin
%  flow requests (possibly asymmetric)
\item $I_A$ is the sum of all collateral independent amounts attached to
  the underlying portfolio of trades (positive amounts imply that the bank
  has received a net inflow of independent amounts from the
  counterparty), assumed here to be cash.
\end{itemize}

As the collateral account already has a value of $C(t_m)$ at time $t_m$, the collateral shortfall is simply the
difference between $C(t_m)$ and $CSA(t_m)$. However, we also need to account for the possibility that margin calls
issued in the past have not yet been settled (for instance, because of disputes). If $M(t_m)$ denotes the net value of
all outstanding margin calls at $t_m$, and $\Delta(t)$ is the difference $\Delta(t) = CSA(t_m) - C(t_m) - M(t_m)$
between the {\em Credit Support Amount} and the current and outstanding collateral, then the actual margin
\emph{Delivery Amount} $D(t_m)$ is calculated as follows:
\begin{align}\label{eq:DA}
D(t_m) &= 
\begin{cases}
\Delta(t),& \left| \Delta(t) \right| \ge MTA \\
0,& \left| \Delta(t) \right| < MTA
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $MTA$ is the minimum transfer amount.

\medskip Finally, the {\em Delivery Amount } is settled with a delay specified by the {\em Margin Period of Risk}
(MPoR) which leads to residual exposure and XVA even for daily margining, zero thresholds and minimum transfer amounts,
see for example \cite{Pykhtin2010}. A more detailed framework for collateralised exposure modelling is introduced in the
2016 article \cite{Andersen2016}, indicating a potential route for extending ORE.

\medskip
In case we use an auxiliary ``close-out'' grid in the simulation (see section \ref{sec:simulation}), we do {\em not} settle the delivery amount with the delay mentioned above. With a close-out grid the portfolio value is rather evolved relative to the collateral balance, also leading to residual exposure. However, the close-out valuation approach allows more detailed modelling of what happens in the close-out period; currently ORE supports two options, with and without portfolio ``ageing'' over the close-out period. The option ``without ageing'' is more aggressive in that it avoids any exposure evolution spikes due to contractual cashflows that occur in the close-out period after default, the only exposure effect is due to market evolution over the period. The ``with ageing'' option is more conservative in that it includes the effect of all contractual cash flows in the close-out period, in particular outgoing cashflows at any time in the period which cause an exposure jump upwards. 

\subsection{Exposure Allocation}\label{sec:app_allocation}

XVAs and exposures are typically computed at netting set level. For accounting purposes it is typically required to {\em
  allocate} XVAs from netting set to individual trade level such that the allocated XVAs add up to the netting set
XVA. This distribution is not trivial, since due to netting and imperfect correlation single trade (stand-alone) XVAs
hardly ever add up to the netting set XVA: XVA is sub-additive similar to VaR. ORE provides an allocation method
(labeled {\em marginal allocation } in the following) which slightly generalises the one proposed in
\cite{PykhtinRosen}. Allocation is done pathwise which first leads to allocated expected exposures and then to allocated
CVA/DVA by inserting these exposures into equations (\ref{CVA},\ref{DVA}). The allocation algorithm in ORE is as
follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider the netting set's discounted $\NPV$ after taking collateral into account, on a given path at time $t$:
$$
E(t)=D(0,t)\,(\NPV(t)-C(t))
$$ 
\item On each path, compute contributions $A_i$ of the latter to trade $i$ as
$$
A_{i} (t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
E(t) \times \NPV_{i}(t) / \NPV(t), & |\NPV(t)| > \epsilon \\
E(t) / n, & |\NPV(t)| \le \epsilon
\end{array}
\right. 
$$
with number of trades $n$ in the netting set and trade $i$'s value $\NPV_i(t)$.
\item The $\EPE$ fraction allocated to trade $i$ at time $t$ by averaging over paths:
$$
\EPE_i(t) = \E\left[ A_i^+(t) \right]
$$
\end{itemize}
By construction, $\sum_i A_i(t) = E(t)$ and hence $\sum_i \EPE_i(t) = \EPE(t)$.\\

We introduced the {\em cutoff } parameter $\epsilon>0$ above in order to handle the case where the netting set value
$\NPV(t)$ (almost) vanishes due to netting, while the netting set 'exposure' $E(t)$ does not. This is possible in a
model with nonzero MTA and MPoR. Since a single scenario with vanishing $\NPV(t)$ suffices to invalidate the expected
exposure at this time $t$, the cutoff is essential. Despite introducing this cutoff, it is obvious that the marginal
allocation method can lead to spikes in the allocated exposures. And generally, the marginal allocation leads to both
positive and negative $\EPE$ allocations.

\medskip As a an example for a simple alternative to the marginal allocation of $\EPE$ we provide allocation based on
today's single-trade CVAs
$$
w_i = \CVA_i / \sum_i \CVA_i.
$$
This yields allocated exposures proportional to the netting set exposure, avoids spikes and negative $\EPE$, but does
not distinguish the 'direction' of each trade's contribution to $\EPE$ and $\CVA$.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}\label{sec:app_sensi}

ORE's sensitivity analysis framework uses ``bump and revalue'' to compute Interest Rate, FX, Inflation, Equity and Credit sensitivities to
\begin{itemize}
\item Discount curves  (in the zero rate domain)
\item Index curves (in the zero rate domain)
\item Yield curves including e.g. equity forecast yield curves (in the zero rate domain)
\item FX Spots
\item FX volatilities
\item Swaption volatilities, ATM matrix or cube 
\item Cap/Floor volatility matrices (in the caplet/floorlet domain)
\item Default probability curves (in the ``zero rate'' domain, expressing survival probabilities $S(t)$ in term of zero rates $z(t)$ via $S(t)=\exp(-z(t)\times t)$ with Actual/365 day counter)
\item Equity spot prices
\item Equity volatilities, ATM or including strike dimension 
\item Zero inflation curves
\item Year-on-Year inflation curves
\item CDS volatilities
\item Base correlation curves
\end{itemize}

Apart from first order sensitivities (deltas), ORE computes second order sensitivities (gammas and cross gammas) as well. Deltas are computed using up-shifts and base values as
$$
\delta = \frac{f(x+\Delta)-f(x)}{\Delta},
$$ 
where the shift $\Delta$ can be absolute or expressed as a relative move $\Delta_r$ from the current level, $\Delta=x\,\Delta_r$. Gammas are computed using up- and down-shifts
$$
\gamma = \frac{f(x+\Delta)+f(x-\Delta) - 2\,f(x)}{\Delta^2},
$$ 
cross gammas using up-shifts and base values as
$$
\gamma_{cross} = \frac{f(x+\Delta_x,y+\Delta_y)-f(x+\Delta_x,y) -f(x,y+\Delta_y) + f(x,y)}{\Delta_x\,\Delta_y}.
$$ 

From the above it is clear that this involves the application of 1-d shifts (e.g. to discount zero curves) and 2-d shifts (e.g. to Swaption volatility matrices). The structure of the shift curves/matrices does not have to match the structure of the underlying data to be shifted, in particular the shift ``curves/matrices'' can be less granular than the market to be shifted. 
Figure \ref{fig_shiftcurve} illustrates for the one-dimensional case how shifts are applied.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{shiftcurve.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{1-d shift curve (bottom) applied to a more granular underlying curve (top). }
\label{fig_shiftcurve}
\end{figure} 

Shifts at the left and right end of the shift curve are extrapolated flat, i.e. applied to all data of the original curve to the left and to the right of the shift curve ends. In between, all shifts are distributed linearly as indicated to the left and right up to the adjacent shift grid points. As a result, a parallel shift of the all points on the shift curve yields a parallel shift of all points on the underlying curve.   \\

The two-dimensional case is covered in an analogous way, applying flat extrapolation at the boundaries and ``pyramidal-shaped'' linear interpolation for the bulk of the points. 

The details of the computation of sensitivities to implied volatilities in strike direction can be summarised as
follows, see also table \ref{sensi_config_overview} for an overview of the admissible configurations and the results
that are obtained using them.

\medskip
For {\em Swaption Volatilities}, the initial market setup can be an ATM surface only or a full cube. The simulation
market can be set up to simulate ATM only or to simulate the full cube, but the latter choice is only possible if a full cube is set
up in the initial market. The sensitivity set up must match the simulation setup with regards to the strikes (i.e. it
is ATM only if and only if the simulation setup is ATM only, or it must contain exactly the same strike spreads relative
to ATM as the simulation setup). Finally, if the initial market setup is a full cube, and the simulation / sensitivity
setup is to simulate ATM only, then sensitivities are computed by shifting the ATM volatility w.r.t. the given shift size and type and
shifting the non-ATM volatilities by the same absolute amount as the ATM volatility.

\medskip
For {\em Cap/Floor Volatilities}, the initial market setup always contains a set of fixed strikes, i.e. there is no
distinction between ATM only and a full surface. The same holds for the simulation market setup. The sensitivity setup
may contain a different strike grid in this case than the simulation market. Sensitivity are computed per expiry and
per strike in every case.

\medskip
For {\em Equity Volatilities}, the initial market setup can be an ATM curve or a full surface. The simulation market can
be set up to simulate ATM only or to simulate the full surface, where a full surface is allowed even if the initial market setup in an
ATM curve only. If we have a full surface in the initial market and simulate the ATM curve only in the simulation market, sensitivities
are computed as in the case of Swaption Volatilities, i.e. the ATM volatility is shifted w.r.t. the specified shift size
and type and the non-ATM volatilities are shifted by the same absolute amount as the ATM volatility. If the simulation
market is set up to simulate the full surface, then all volatilities are shifted individually using the specified shift size and type. In
every case the sensitivities are aggregated on the ATM bucket in the sensitivity report.

\medskip
For {\em FX Volatilities}, the treatment is similar to Equity Volatilities, except for the case of a full surface
definition in the initial market and an ATM only curve in the simulation market. In this case, the pricing in the
simulation market is using the ATM curve only, i.e. the initial market's smile structure is lost.

\medskip
For {\em CDS Volatilities} only an ATM curve can be defined.

\medskip
In all cases the smile dynamics is ``sticky strike'', i.e. the implied vol used for pricing a deal does not change if
the underlying spot price changes.

\subsection{Value at Risk}\label{sec:app_var}

For the computation of the parametric, or variance-covariance VaR, we rely on a second order sensitivity-based P\&L approximation

\begin{eqnarray}\label{taylorPl2}
  \pi_S & = & \sum_{i=1}^n D^i_{T_i}\,V\cdot Y_i 
        + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^n D^{i,j}_{T_i,T_j}\,V\cdot Y_i\cdot Y_j
\end{eqnarray}

with 
\begin{itemize}
\item portfolio value $V$
\item random variables $Y_i$ representing risk factor returns; these are assumed to be multivariate normally distributed with zero mean
and covariance matrix matrix $C = \{ \rho_{i,k} \sigma_i \sigma_k \}_{i,k}$, where $\sigma_i$ denotes the standard
deviation of $Y_i$; covariance matrix $C$ may be estimated using the Pearson estimator on historical return data
$\{ r_i(j) \}_{i,j}$. Since the raw estimate might not be positive semidefinite, we apply a salvaging algorithm to
ensure this property, which basically replaces negative Eigenvalues by zero and renormalises the resulting matrix, see
\cite{corrSalv};
\item first or second order derivative operators $D$, depending
on the market factor specific shift type $T_i \in \{ A,R,L \}$ (absolute shifts, relative shifts, absolute log-shifts), i.e.
\begin{eqnarray*}\label{derivs}
  D^i_A \,V(x) &=& \frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x_i} \\
  D^i_R \,V(x) = D^i_L f(x) &=& x_i\frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x_i}
\end{eqnarray*}
and using the short hand notation
\begin{equation*}
  D^{i,j}_{T_i,T_j} V(x) = D^i_{T_i} D^j_{T_j} V(x)
\end{equation*}
In ORE, these first and second order sensitivities are computed as finite difference
approximations (``bump and revalue'').
\end{itemize}

To approximate the $p$-quantile of $\pi_S$ in \eqref{taylorPl2} ORE offers the techniques outlined below.

\subsubsection*{Delta Gamma Normal Approximation}
 
The distribution of \eqref{taylorPl2} is non-normal due to the second order terms. 
The delta gamma normal approximation in ORE computes mean $m$ and variance $v$ of the portfolio value change $\pi_S$ (discarding moments higher than two) following \cite{alexander} and provides a simple VaR estimate 
$$
VaR = m + N^{-1}(q)\,\sqrt{v}
$$
for the desired quantile $q$ ($N$ is the cumulative standard normal distribution). Omitting the second order terms in \eqref{taylorPl2} yields the delta normal approximation.
 
\subsubsection*{Monte Carlo Simulation}

By simulating a large number of realisations of the return vector $Y=\{ Y_i \}_i$ and computing the corresponding
realisations of $\pi_S$ in \eqref{taylorPl2} we can estimate the desired quantile as the quantile of the empirical
distribution generated by the Monte Carlo samples. Apart from the Monte Carlo Error no approximation is involved in this
method, so that albeit slow it is well suited to produce values against which any other approximate approaches can be tested. Numerically, the simulation is implemented using a Cholesky Decomposition
of the covariance matrix $C$ in conjunction with a pseudo random number generator (Mersenne Twister) and an
implementation of the inverse cumulative normal distribution to transform $U[0,1]$ variates to $N(0,1)$ variates.
