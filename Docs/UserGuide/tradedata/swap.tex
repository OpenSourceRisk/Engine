\subsubsection{Swap}

The \lstinline!SwapData! node is the trade data container for the \emph{Swap} trade type. A Swap must have at least one leg,
and can have an unlimited number of legs. Each leg is represented by a \lstinline!LegData! trade component sub-node,
described in section \ref{ss:leg_data}. An example structure of a two-legged \lstinline!SwapData!
node is shown in Listing \ref{lst:swap_data}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Settlement [Optional]: Delivery type applicable to cross currency swaps, and ignored for all other swap types. Delivery type does not impact pricing in ORE.  

Settlement \emph{Cash} indicates that principal exchanges on the cross currency swap should be included in Initial Margin (IM). According to ISDA non-deliverable (\emph{Cash}) trades are excluded from the exemption from IM for the principal exchange, i.e. the principal exchanges are included in IM. 

Settlement \emph{Physical} indicates that principal exchanges on the cross currency swap should be excluded in IM (the ISDA exemption applies).  

Allowable values: \emph{Cash} or \emph{Physical}.  Defaults to \emph{Physical} if left blank or omitted.
