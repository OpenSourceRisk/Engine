\subsubsection{Commodity Variance and Volatility Swap}
\label{SubSectionCommodityVarianceSwap}

The \lstinline!CommodityVarianceSwapData! node is the trade data container for the \emph{CommodityVarianceSwap} trade type. 
The structure of an example \lstinline!CommodityVarianceSwapData! node for a Commodity Variance Swap is the same as for an Equity Variance Swap in section
\ref{SubSectionEqVarianceSwap}, with the exception of the underlying node which is of type 'Commodity' here.
See section \ref{ss:underlying} for additional optional elements of the underlying node and allowable values.
