\subsubsection{FX Variance and Volatility Swap}
\label{SubSectionFxVarianceSwap}

The \lstinline!FxVarianceSwapData! node is the trade data container for the \emph{FxVarianceSwap} trade type. Only vanilla variance swaps are supported by this trade type - exotic variance swaps are supported by ScriptedTrade\ifdefined\ProductCatalogueBuild, see  \ref{SubSectionExoticVarianceSwap}. \else. \fi
The structure of an example \lstinline!VarianceSwapData! node for an FX variance swap is shown in Listing \ref{lst:fxvarswap_data}.

The meanings and allowable values of the elements in the \lstinline!FxVarianceSwapData! node below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item StartDate: The variance swap start date. \\
	Allowable values: See \lstinline!Date! in Table \ref{tab:allow_stand_data}.
	\item EndDate: The variance swap end date. \\
	Allowable values: See \lstinline!Date! in Table \ref{tab:allow_stand_data}.
	\item Currency: The bought currency of the variance swap. \\
	Allowable values: See Table \ref{tab:currency} \lstinline!Currency!.		
	\item Name: The identifier of the underlying currency pair.  \\
	Allowable values:  A string of the form SOURCE-CCY1-CCY2, where SOURCE is the fixing source and the fixing is expressed as amount in CCY2 per one unit of CCY1. \\ See Table \ref{tab:fxindex_data}. Note that FxVarianceSwap is an exception in that the ordering of CCY1 and CCY2 must be set up as for {\tt FxIndex}.
	\item Underlying:  This node may be used as an alternative to the \lstinline!Name! node to specify the underlying FX.  The \lstinline!Underlying! node is described in further detail in Section \ref{ss:underlying}. \\
	\item LongShort: Defines whether the trade is long in the FX variance. For the avoidance of doubt, a long FX swap has positive value if the realised variance exceeds the variance strike. \\
	Allowable values: \emph{Long, Short}	
	\item Strike: The volatility strike $K_{vol}$ of the variance swap quoted absolutely (i.e. not as a percent). If the swap was struck in terms of variance, the square root of that variance should be used here.\\
	Allowable values: Any positive real number.	
	\item Notional: The vega notional of the variance swap. This is the notional in terms of volatility units (like the strike). If the swap was struck in terms of a variance notional $N_{var}$, the corresponding vega notional is given by $N_{vol} = N_{var} * 2 * 100 * K_{vol}$ (where $K_{vol}$ is in absolute terms).\\
	Allowable values: Any non-negative real number.
	\item Calendar: The calendar determining the observation/fixing dates according to which variance is accrued is the combination of the calendar(s) given here plus the combined calendars of the two involved currencies. \\
	Allowable values: See Table \ref{tab:calendar}.	
	\item MomentType[Optional]: A flag to distinguish if the swap is struck in terms of volatility or variance. The MomentType should be set to \emph{Volatility} or \emph{Variance} depending on the payoff.  Note that MomentType does not necessarily need to be equivalent to the way the Strike is quoted which is always as a Volatility.\\
	Allowable values: \emph{Volatility} or \emph{Variance}. Defaults to \emph{Variance} if left blank or omitted.
\end{itemize}

Note that FX Variance and Volatility Swaps also cover Precious Metals, i.e. with
currencies XAU, XAG, XPT, XPD, and Cryptocurrencies,  see supported Cryptocurrencies in Table \ref{tab:currency}.
