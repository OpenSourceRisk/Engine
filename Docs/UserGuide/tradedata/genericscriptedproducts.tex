\subsubsection{Generic Scripted Products}
\label{sec:genericscriptedproducts}

The products in sections \ref{sec:doubledigitaloption} to \ref{sec:tarf} are internally represented as {\em Scripted Trades},
but ``wrapped'' such that their input XML format still looks like ``classic'' ORE XML.

With \ref{sec:rainbowoption} and \ref{SubSectionExoticVarianceSwap} we have seen two examples of the generic Scripted Trade input format.

The Scripted Trade module allows flexible definition of new payoffs across five of the six asset classes covered in ORE,
just by way of defining the payoff script. The payoff script can be embedded into the trade XML or can be placed into a separate
script library.

Refer to the stand-alone Scripted Trade documentation in ore/Docs/ScriptedTrade or section \label{app:scriptedtrade} for an
introduction.
