\subsubsection{Cap/Floor}

The \lstinline!CapFloorData! node is the trade data container for trade type CapFloors.  It's a cap, floor or collar
(i.e. a portfolio of a long cap and a short floor for a long position in the collar) on a series of Ibor or CMS rates. The
\lstinline!CapFloorData! node contains a \lstinline!LongShort! sub-node which indicates whether the cap (floor, collar)
is long or short, and a \lstinline!LegData!  sub-node where the LegType element must be set to \emph{Floating} or \emph{CMS}, plus
elements for the Cap and Floor rates. An example structure with Cap rates is shown in in Listing
\ref{lst:capfloor_data}. A \lstinline!CapFloorData! node must have either \lstinline!Caps! or \lstinline!Floors!
elements, or both.

The meanings and allowable values of the elements in the \lstinline!CapFloorData!  node follow below.

\begin{itemize}

\item LongShort: This node defines the position in the cap (floor, collar) and can take values \emph{Long} or \emph{Short}.

\item LegData: This is a trade component sub-node outlined in section \ref{ss:leg_data}. Exactly
  one \lstinline!LegData! node is allowed and the LegType element must be set to \emph{Floating} or \emph{CMS}.

\item Caps: This node has child elements of type \lstinline!Rate!
  capping the floating leg. The first rate value corresponds to the
  first coupon, the second rate value corresponds to the second
  coupon, etc. If the number of coupons exceeds the number of rate
  values, the rate will be kept flat at the value of last entered rate
  for the remaining coupons. For a fixed cap rate over all coupons,
  one single rate value is sufficient. The number of entered rate
  values cannot exceed the number of coupons. 

  Allowable values for each \lstinline!Rate! element: Any real number. The rate is expressed in decimal form, eg 0.05 is
  a rate of 5\%

\item Floors: This node has child elements of type
  \lstinline!Rate! flooring the floating leg.  The first rate value
  corresponds to the first coupon, the second rate value corresponds
  to the second coupon, etc. If the number of coupons exceeds the
  number of rate values, the rate will be kept flat at the value of
  last entered rate for the remaining coupons. For a fixed floor rate
  over all coupons, one single rate value is sufficient. The number of
  entered rate values cannot exceed the number of coupons.

  Allowable values for each \lstinline!Rate! element: Any real number. The rate is expressed in decimal form, eg 0.05 is
  a rate of 5\%
