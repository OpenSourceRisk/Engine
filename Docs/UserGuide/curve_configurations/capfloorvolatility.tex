\subsubsection{Cap Floor Volatility Structures}

The cap volatility structure parameterisation allows the user to pick out term cap volatilities in the market data and define how they should be stripped to create an optionlet volatility structure. The parameterisation allows for three separate types of input term cap volatility structures:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A strip of at-the-money (ATM) cap volatilities.
\item A cap maturity tenor by absolute cap strike grid of cap volatilities.
\item A combined structure containing both the ATM cap volatilities and the maturity by strike grid of cap volatilities.
\end{enumerate}

The input cap volatilities may be normal, lognormal or shifted lognormal. The structure of the market quotes is provided in Table \ref{tab:capfloor_implvol_quote}.

The structure of the XML, i.e.\ the nodes that are necessary, used and ignored, and the way that the optionlet volatilities are stripped hinges on the value of the \lstinline!InterpolateOn! node. This node may be set to \lstinline!TermVolatilities! or \lstinline!OptionletVolatilities!.

When set to \lstinline!TermVolatilities!, a column of sequential caps or floors, are created for each strike level out to the maximum cap maturity configured. In other words, if the index tenor is 6M, the first cap created would have a maturity of 1Y, the second cap 18M, the third cap 2Y and so on until we have a cap with maturity equal to the maximum maturity tenor in the configuration. The volatility for each of these caps or floors is then interpolated from the term cap volatility surface using the configured interpolation. Finally, the optionlet volatility at each cap or floor maturity, starting from the first, is derived in turn such that the column of cap or floor volatilities are matched.

When set to \lstinline!OptionletVolatilities!, the optionlet volatility structure pillar dates are set to the fixing dates on the last caplet on each of the configured caps or floors i.e.\ caps or floors with the maturities in the configured \lstinline!Tenors! or \lstinline!AtmTenors!. The optionlet volatilities on these pillar dates are then solved for such that the configured cap or floor volatilities are matched. In the following sections, we describe four XML configurations separately for clarity:

\begin{enumerate}
\item ATM curve with interpolation on term volatilities.
\item ATM curve with interpolation on optionlet volatilities.
\item Surface, possibly including an ATM column, with interpolation on term volatilities.
\item Surface, possibly including an ATM column, with interpolation on optionlet volatilities.
\end{enumerate}

Listing \ref{lst:capfloorvol_atm_configuration_term} shows the layout for parameterising an ATM cap volatility curve with interpolation on term volatilities. Nodes that have no effect for this parameterisation but that are allowed by the schema are not referenced. The meaning of each of the nodes is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\lstinline!CurveId!: Unique identifier for the cap floor volatility structure.

\item \lstinline!CurveDescription! [Optional]:
A description of the volatility structure. It is for information only and may be left blank.

\item \lstinline!VolatilityType!:
Indicates the cap floor volatility type. It may be \lstinline!Normal!, \lstinline!Lognormal! or \lstinline!ShiftedLognormal!. Note that this then determines which market data points are looked up in the market when creating the ATM cap floor curve and how they are interpreted when stripping the optionlets. In particular, the market will be searched for market data points of the form \lstinline!CAPFLOOR/RATE_NVOL/Currency/Tenor/IndexTenor/1/1/0!, \lstinline!CAPFLOOR/RATE_LNVOL/Currency/Tenor/IndexTenor/1/1/0! or \lstinline!CAPFLOOR/RATE_SLNVOL/Currency/Tenor/IndexTenor/1/1/0! respectively.

\item \lstinline!Extrapolation!:
Indicates the extrapolation in the time direction before the first optionlet volatility and after the last optionlet volatility. The extrapolation occurs on the stripped optionlet volatilities. The allowable values are \lstinline!None!, \lstinline!Flat! and \lstinline!Linear!. If set to \lstinline!None!, extrapolation is turned off and an exception is thrown if the optionlet surface is queried outside the allowable times. If set to \lstinline!Flat!, the first optionlet volatility is used before the first time and the last optionlet volatility is used after the last time. If set to \lstinline!Linear!, the interpolation method configured in \lstinline!InterpolationMethod! is used to extrapolate.

\item \lstinline!InterpolationMethod! [Optional]:
Indicates the interpolation in the time direction. As \lstinline!InterpolateOn! is set to \lstinline!TermVolatilities! here, the interpolation is used in the stripping process to interpolate the term cap floor volatility curve as explained above. It is also used to interpolate the optionlet volatilities when an optionlet volatility is queried from the stripped optionlet structure. The allowable values are \lstinline!Bilinear! and \lstinline!BicubicSpline!. If not set, \lstinline!BicubicSpline! is assumed. Obviously, as we are describing an ATM curve here, there is no interpolation in the strike direction so when \lstinline!Bilinear! is set the time interpolation is linear and when \lstinline!BicubicSpline! is set the time interpolation is cubic spline.

\item \lstinline!IncludeAtm!:
A boolean value indicating if an ATM curve should be used. Allowable boolean values are given in the Table \ref{tab:boolean_allowable}. As we are describing an ATM curve here, this node should be set to \lstinline!true! as shown in \ref{lst:capfloorvol_atm_configuration_term}.

\item \lstinline!DayCounter!:
The day counter used to convert from dates to times in the underlying structure. Allowable values are given in the Table \ref{tab:daycount}.

\item \lstinline!Calendar!:
The calendar used to advance dates by periods in the underlying structure. In particular, it is used in deriving the cap maturity dates from the configured cap tenors. Allowable values are given in the Table \ref{tab:calendar}.

\item \lstinline!BusinessDayConvention!:
The business day convention used to advance dates by periods in the underlying structure. In particular, it is used in deriving the cap maturity dates from the configured cap tenors. Allowable values are given in the Table \ref{tab:allow_stand_data} under \lstinline!Roll Convention!.

\item \lstinline!Tenors! [Optional]:
A comma separated list of valid tenor strings giving the cap floor maturity tenors to be used in the ATM curve. If omitted, the tenors for the ATM curve must be provided in the \lstinline!AtmTenors! node instead. If the tenors are provided here, the \lstinline!AtmTenors! node may be omitted.

\item \lstinline!IborIndex!:
A valid interest rate index name giving the index underlying the cap floor quotes. Allowable values are given in the Table \ref{tab:indices}.

\item \lstinline!DiscountCurve!:
A reference to a valid discount curve specification that will be used to discount cashflows during the stripping process. It should be of the form \lstinline!Yield/Currency/curve_name! where \lstinline!curve_name! is the name of a yield curve defined in the yield curve configurations.

\item \lstinline!AtmTenors! [Optional]:
A comma separated list of valid tenor strings giving the cap floor maturities to be used in the ATM curve. If omitted, the tenors for the ATM curve must be provided in the \lstinline!Tenors! node instead. If the tenors are provided here, the \lstinline!Tenors! node may be omitted.

\item \lstinline!SettlementDays! [Optional]:
Any non-negative integer is allowed here. If omitted, it is assumed to be 0. If provided the reference date of the term volatility curve and the stripped optionlet volatility structure will be calculated by advancing the valuation date by this number of days using the configured calendar and business day convention. In general, this should be omitted or set to 0.

\item \lstinline!InterpolateOn!:
As referenced above, the allowable values are \lstinline!TermVolatilities! or \lstinline!OptionletVolatilities!. As we are describing here an ATM curve with interpolation on term volatilities, this should be set to \lstinline!TermVolatilities! as shown in Listing \ref{lst:capfloorvol_atm_configuration_term}.

\item \lstinline!BootstrapConfig! [Optional]:
This node holds configuration details for the iterative bootstrap that are described in section \ref{sec:bootstrap_config}. If omitted, this node's default values described in section \ref{sec:bootstrap_config} are used.

Listing \ref{lst:capfloorvol_surface_configuration_term} shows the layout for parameterising a cap tenor by absolute cap strike volatility surface with interpolation on term volatilities. This parameterisation also allows for the inclusion of a cap floor ATM curve in combination with the surface.
