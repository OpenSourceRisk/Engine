\subsubsection{Bond Future}
\label{pricing::bondfuture}

The present value $v$ of a long bond future contract is given by

$$
v = N P(0,T) ( F - K ) C
$$

with

\begin{itemize}
\item $N$: Future contract notional
\item $T$: Future settlement date
\item $P(0,T)$: Discount factor for $T$ on the relevant collateral curve
\item $F$: The estimated future price at the future expiry date
\item $K$: The strike, which is the current traded future price
\item $C$: The conversion factor for the CTD bond
\end{itemize}

Note that the strike $K$ is technically the historical fixing value of the future at the valuation date and the
estimated future price $F$ is calculated as the forward price of the current CTD bond divided by the conversion
factor $C$. Since the security spread of the CTD bond is calibrated to the quoted future price the present value $v$ will be
$0$ if the historical fixing on the valuation date is equal to quoted future price. This reflects the situation after
daily margining when the future contract indeed has zero value.
