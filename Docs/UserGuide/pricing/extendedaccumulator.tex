\subsubsection{Extended Accumulator}
\label{pricing:extended_accumulator}
 
An Extended Accumulator is an exchange of notionals at multiple times in the future. We buy B and sell A. 
$$
\NPV= \sum LongShort \cdot N \cdot (K - X_A(T))
$$
Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$: the notional amount in currency/unit of A
\item $K$: the strike rate
\item $X_A(T)$: the exchanged element - a rate or unit
\end{itemize}
