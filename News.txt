  timing at default/period end/maturity
- Allow floating coupons with sub periods, i.e. several fixings per coupon period
  that are averaged or compounded
- Allow Caps/Floors on BMA/SIFMA and overnight indices
- Allow adding new leg types via a LegDataFactory

MARKETS

- Currencies: 73 mapped
- Calendars: 88 mapped by country, city, ISO 10383 MIC, ISO 4217 currency code,
  ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 and 3 country codes
- Allow large joint calendars
- OIS indices: 19 mapped including USD-Prime, EUR-ESTER and USD-SOFR
- IBOR indices: 43 mapped using "hard coded" index names
- Inflation indices: 9 mapped
- Add IBOR and CMS indices that can be defined in conventions, so that they can be
  added to ORE without code changes

TERM STRUCTURES

- Add fitted Bond yield curves
- When bootstrapping a default curve from CDS, allow for retries with widening of
  search bounds. Avoids exceptions for distressed CDS curves for example.
- Inflation cap/floor volatility surfaces cleaned up, inflation price surfaces removed
  from the market interface
- Equity volatility surface changes, clean up and stripping from option premiums,
  allow wildcard in strike/expiry config, add Equity volatility surface proxies
- Allow optional quotes in curve configurations
- New Equity forward curve stripper that allows a dividend yield to be determined from
  equity option premiums
- ESTER/SOFR basic curve building
- New cap/floor optionlet stripper that uses an iterative bootstrap with configurable
  interpolation/extrapolation in expiry and strike direction.
- New CDS volatility configuration to allow for constant volatility, a volatility
  curve or an expiry x strike surface
- Added Commodity basis price curve and average basis price curve

ANALYTICS

- Fix volatility conversion for lognormal swaption cubes in ScenarioSimMarket
- Cross Asset Model refactoring to allow alternative risk factor evolution models 
- Bermudan Swaption LGM calibration changes (allow to continue processing when
  tolerance is breached, allow to thin out calibration grids)
- Improve performance of analytic LGM swaption engine by introducing a cache
  (speeds up LGM calibration)
- Add Indexed coupon class
- Add CDS to stress testing capability

UNIT TESTS

- QuantExt unit test cases: 180 test functions, 3749 data-driven cases
- OREData unit tests: 135 test functions, 368 data-driven cases 
- OREAnalytics unit tests: 61 test functions and cases
i.e. 609 test functions vs 429 in the previous release.

For example:
"./quantext-test-suite" reports 3749 cases
"./quantext-test-suite --list_cases | grep test" lists 180 test functions

EXAMPLES
